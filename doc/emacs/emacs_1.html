  This manual documents the use and simple customization of the
Emacs editor.  The reader is not expected to be a programmer.  Even simple
customizations do not require programming skill, but the user who is not
interested in customizing can ignore the scattered customization hints.
<P>
  This is primarily a reference manual, but can also be used as a
primer.  However, I recommend that the newcomer first use the on-line,
learn-by-doing tutorial, which you get by running Emacs and typing
<KBD>C-h t</KBD>.  With it, you learn Emacs by using Emacs on a specially
designed file which describes commands, tells you when to try them,
and then explains the results you see.  This gives a more vivid
introduction than a printed manual.
<P>
  On first reading, just skim chapters one and two, which describe the
notational conventions of the manual and the general appearance of the
Emacs display screen.  Note which questions are answered in these chapters,
so you can refer back later.  After reading chapter four you should
practice the commands there.  The next few chapters describe fundamental
techniques and concepts that are used constantly.  You need to understand
them thoroughly, experimenting with them if necessary.
<P>
  To find the documentation on a particular command, look in the index.
Keys (character commands) and command names have separate indexes.  There
is also a glossary, with a cross reference for each term.
<P>
  This manual comes in two forms: the published form and the Info form.
The Info form is for on-line perusal with the Info program; this form of
the manual and the Info program itself are distributed along with GNU
Emacs.  Both forms contain substantially the same text and are generated
from a common source file, which is also distributed along with GNU
Emacs.
<P>
  GNU Emacs is a member of the Emacs editor family.  There are many Emacs
editors, all sharing common principles of organization.  For information on
the underlying philosophy of Emacs and the lessons learned from its
development, write for a copy of AI memo 519a, "Emacs, the Extensible,
Customizable Self-Documenting Display Editor", to Publications Department,
Artificial Intelligence Lab, 545 Tech Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.  At
last report they charge $2.25 per copy.  Another useful publication is LCS
TM-165, "A Cookbook for an Emacs", by Craig Finseth, available from
Publications Department, Laboratory for Computer Science, 545 Tech Square,
Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.  The price today is $3.
<P>
This edition of the manual is intended for use with GNU Emacs installed on
Unix systems.  GNU Emacs can also be used on VMS systems, which have
different file name syntax and do not support all GNU Emacs features.  A
VMS edition of this manual may appear in the future.
