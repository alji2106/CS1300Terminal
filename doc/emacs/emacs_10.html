<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
<H1><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC30">The Minibuffer</A></H1>
<P>
  The <DFN>minibuffer</DFN> is the facility used by Emacs commands to read
arguments more complicated than a single number.  Minibuffer arguments
can be file names, buffer names, Lisp function names, Emacs command
names, Lisp expressions, and many other things, depending on the command
reading the argument.  You can use the usual Emacs editing commands in
the minibuffer to edit the argument text.
<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
<P>
  When the minibuffer is in use, it appears in the echo area, and the
terminal's cursor moves there.  The beginning of the minibuffer line
displays a <DFN>prompt</DFN> which says what kind of input you should supply and
how it will be used.  Often this prompt is derived from the name of the
command that the argument is for.  The prompt normally ends with a colon.
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
<P>
  Sometimes a <DFN>default argument</DFN> appears in parentheses after the
colon; it too is part of the prompt.  The default will be used as the
argument value if you enter an empty argument (e.g., just type <KBD>RET</KBD>).
For example, commands that read buffer names always show a default, which
is the name of the buffer that will be used if you type just <KBD>RET</KBD>.
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>
<P>
  The simplest way to enter a minibuffer argument is to type the text you
want, terminated by <KBD>RET</KBD> which exits the minibuffer.  You can get out
of the minibuffer, canceling the command that it was for, by typing
<KBD>C-g</KBD>.
<P>
  Since the minibuffer uses the screen space of the echo area, it can
conflict with other ways Emacs customarily uses the echo area.  Here is how
Emacs handles such conflicts:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
If a command gets an error while you are in the minibuffer, this does
not cancel the minibuffer.  However, the echo area is needed for the
error message and therefore the minibuffer itself is hidden for a
while.  It comes back after a few seconds, or as soon as you type
anything.
<P>
<LI>
If in the minibuffer you use a command whose purpose is to print a
message in the echo area, such as <KBD>C-x =</KBD>, the message is printed
normally, and the minibuffer is hidden for a while.  It comes back
after a few seconds, or as soon as you type anything.
<P>
<LI>
Echoing of keystrokes does not take place while the minibuffer is in
use.
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC31">Minibuffers for File Names</A></H2>
<P>
  Sometimes the minibuffer starts out with text in it.  For example, when
you are supposed to give a file name, the minibuffer starts out containing
the <DFN>default directory</DFN>, which ends with a slash.  This is to inform
you which directory the file will be found in if you do not specify a
directory.  For example, the minibuffer might start out with
<P>
<PRE>
Find File: /u2/emacs/src/
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`Find File: '</SAMP> is the prompt.  Typing <KBD>buffer.c</KBD>
specifies the file <TT>`/u2/emacs/src/buffer.c'</TT>.  To find files in
nearby directories, use <KBD>..</KBD>; thus, if you type
<KBD>../lisp/simple.el</KBD>, you will get the file named
<TT>`/u2/emacs/lisp/simple.el'</TT>.  Alternatively, you can kill with
<KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> the directory names you don't want
(see section <A HREF="emacs_25.html#SEC156">Words</A>).<P>
  You can also type an absolute file name, one starting with a slash or
a tilde, ignoring the default directory.  For example, to find the file
<TT>`/etc/termcap'</TT>, just insert that name, giving these minibuffer
contents:
<P>
<PRE>
Find File: /u2/emacs/src//etc/termcap
</PRE>
<P>
Two slashes in a row are not normally meaningful in a file name, but
they are allowed in GNU Emacs.  They mean, "ignore everything before the
second slash in the pair."  Thus, <SAMP>`/u2/emacs/src/'</SAMP> is ignored, and
you get the file <TT>`/etc/termcap'</TT>.
<P>
  If you set <CODE>insert-default-directory</CODE> to <CODE>nil</CODE>, the default
directory is not inserted in the minibuffer.  This way, the minibuffer
starts out empty.  But the name you type, if relative, is still
interpreted with respect to the same default directory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC32">Editing in the Minibuffer</A></H2>
<P>
  The minibuffer is an Emacs buffer (albeit a peculiar one), and the usual
Emacs commands are available for editing the text of an argument you are
entering.
<P>
  Since <KBD>RET</KBD> in the minibuffer is defined to exit the minibuffer,
inserting a newline into the minibuffer must be done with <KBD>C-o</KBD> or with
<KBD>C-q <KBD>LFD</KBD></KBD>.  (Recall that a newline is really the <KBD>LFD</KBD>
character.)
<P>
  The minibuffer has its own window which always has space on the screen
but acts as if it were not there when the minibuffer is not in use.  When
the minibuffer is in use, its window is just like the others; you can
switch to another window with <KBD>C-x o</KBD>, edit text in other windows and
perhaps even visit more files, before returning to the minibuffer to submit
the argument.  You can kill text in another window, return to the
minibuffer window, and then yank the text to use it in the argument.
See section <A HREF="emacs_21.html#SEC133">Multiple Windows</A>.
<P>
  There are some restrictions on the use of the minibuffer window, however.
You cannot switch buffers in it--the minibuffer and its window are
permanently attached.  Also, you cannot split or kill the minibuffer
window.  But you can make it taller in the normal fashion with <KBD>C-x ^</KBD>.
<P>
  If while in the minibuffer you issue a command that displays help text
of any sort in another window, you can use the <KBD>C-M-v</KBD> command while
in the minibuffer to scroll the help text.  This lasts until you exit
the minibuffer.  This feature is especially useful if a completing
minibuffer gives you a list of possible completions.  See section <A HREF="emacs_21.html#SEC136">Using Other Windows</A>.
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<P>
  You can't use a command that reads a minibuffer argument while you are
in the minibuffer window.  This rule is to prevent recursive minibuffers
from confusing novice users.  If you want to be able to use such
commands in the minibuffer, set the variable
<CODE>enable-recursive-minibuffers</CODE> to a non-<CODE>nil</CODE> value.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC33">Completion</A></H2>
<P>
  For certain kinds of arguments, you can use <DFN>completion</DFN> to enter
the argument value.  Completion means that you type part of the
argument, then Emacs visibly fills in the rest, or as much as
can be determined from the part you have typed.
<P>
  When completion is available, certain keys---<KBD>TAB</KBD>, <KBD>RET</KBD>, and
<KBD>SPC</KBD>---are rebound to complete the text present in the minibuffer
into a longer string that it stands for, by matching it against a set of
<DFN>completion alternatives</DFN> provided by the command reading the
argument.  <KBD>?</KBD> is defined to display a list of possible completions
of what you have inserted.
<P>
  For example, when <KBD>M-x</KBD> uses the minibuffer to read the name of a
command, it provides a list of all available Emacs command names to
complete against.  The completion keys match the text in the minibuffer
against all the command names, find any additional name characters
implied by the ones already present in the minibuffer, and add those
characters to the ones you have given.  This is what makes it possible
to type <KBD>M-x ins <KBD>SPC</KBD> b <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD> instead of <KBD>M-x
insert-buffer <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD> (for example).
<P>
  Case is normally significant in completion, because it is significant
in most of the names that you can complete (buffer names, file names and
command names).  Thus, <SAMP>`fo'</SAMP> does not complete to <SAMP>`Foo'</SAMP>.
Completion does ignore case distinctions for certain arguments in which
case does not matter.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC34">Completion Example</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
<A NAME="IDX146"></A>
<P>
  A concrete example may help here.  If you type <KBD>M-x au <KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>,
the <KBD>TAB</KBD> looks for alternatives (in this case, command names) that
start with <SAMP>`au'</SAMP>.  There are only two: <CODE>auto-fill-mode</CODE> and
<CODE>auto-save-mode</CODE>.  These are the same as far as <CODE>auto-</CODE>, so the
<SAMP>`au'</SAMP> in the minibuffer changes to <SAMP>`auto-'</SAMP>.<P>
  If you type <KBD>TAB</KBD> again immediately, there are multiple
possibilities for the very next character--it could be <SAMP>`s'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`f'</SAMP>---so no more characters are added; instead, <KBD>TAB</KBD> displays
a list of all possible completions in another window.
<P>
  If you go on to type <KBD>f <KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>, this <KBD>TAB</KBD> sees
<SAMP>`auto-f'</SAMP>.  The only command name starting this way is
<CODE>auto-fill-mode</CODE>, so completion fills in the rest of that.  You now
have <SAMP>`auto-fill-mode'</SAMP> in the minibuffer after typing just <KBD>au
<KBD>TAB</KBD> f <KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>.  Note that <KBD>TAB</KBD> has this effect because in
the minibuffer it is bound to the command <CODE>minibuffer-complete</CODE>
when completion is available.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC35">Completion Commands</A></H3>
<P>
  Here is a list of the completion commands defined in the minibuffer
when completion is available.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD><KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Complete the text in the minibuffer as much as possible
(<CODE>minibuffer-complete</CODE>).
<DT><KBD><KBD>SPC</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Complete the minibuffer text, but don't go beyond one word
(<CODE>minibuffer-complete-word</CODE>).
<DT><KBD><KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Submit the text in the minibuffer as the argument, possibly completing
first as described below (<CODE>minibuffer-complete-and-exit</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>?</KBD>
<DD>Print a list of all possible completions of the text in the minibuffer
(<CODE>minibuffer-list-completions</CODE>).
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
<DT><KBD>Mouse-2</KBD>
<DD>Clicking mouse button 2 on a completion in the list of possible
completions chooses that completion (<CODE>mouse-choose-completion</CODE>).
Like the above commands, this command is used while you are in the
minibuffer; but click in the list of completions, not in the minibuffer
itself.
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
<P>
  <KBD>SPC</KBD> completes much like <KBD>TAB</KBD>, but never goes beyond the
next hyphen or space.  If you have <SAMP>`auto-f'</SAMP> in the minibuffer and
type <KBD>SPC</KBD>, it finds that the completion is <SAMP>`auto-fill-mode'</SAMP>,
but it stops completing after <SAMP>`fill-'</SAMP>.  This gives
<SAMP>`auto-fill-'</SAMP>.  Another <KBD>SPC</KBD> at this point completes all the
way to <SAMP>`auto-fill-mode'</SAMP>.  <KBD>SPC</KBD> in the minibuffer when
completion is available runs the command
<CODE>minibuffer-complete-word</CODE>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC36">Strict Completion</A></H3>
<P>
  There are three different ways that <KBD>RET</KBD> can work in completing
minibuffers, depending on how the argument will be used.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DFN>Strict</DFN> completion is used when it is meaningless to give any
argument except one of the known alternatives.  For example, when
<KBD>C-x k</KBD> reads the name of a buffer to kill, it is meaningless to
give anything but the name of an existing buffer.  In strict
completion, <KBD>RET</KBD> refuses to exit if the text in the minibuffer
does not complete to an exact match.
<P>
<LI>
<DFN>Cautious</DFN> completion is similar to strict completion, except that
<KBD>RET</KBD> exits only if the text was an exact match already, not
needing completion.  If the text is not an exact match, <KBD>RET</KBD> does
not exit, but it does complete the text.  If it completes to an exact
match, a second <KBD>RET</KBD> will exit.
<P>
Cautious completion is used for reading file names for files that must
already exist.
<P>
<LI>
<DFN>Permissive</DFN> completion is used when any string whatever is
meaningful, and the list of completion alternatives is just a guide.
For example, when <KBD>C-x C-f</KBD> reads the name of a file to visit, any
file name is allowed, in case you want to create a file.  In
permissive completion, <KBD>RET</KBD> takes the text in the minibuffer
exactly as given, without completing it.
</UL>
<P>
  The completion commands display a list of all possible completions in
a window whenever there is more than one possibility for the very next
character.  Also, typing <KBD>?</KBD> explicitly requests such a list.  If
the list of completions is long, you can scroll it with <KBD>C-M-v</KBD>
(see section <A HREF="emacs_21.html#SEC136">Using Other Windows</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC37">Completion Options</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
<P>
  When completion is done on file names, certain file names are usually
ignored.  The variable <CODE>completion-ignored-extensions</CODE> contains a
list of strings; a file whose name ends in any of those strings is
ignored as a possible completion.  The standard value of this variable
has several elements including <CODE>".o"</CODE>, <CODE>".elc"</CODE>, <CODE>".dvi"</CODE>
and <CODE>"~"</CODE>.  The effect is that, for example, <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> can
complete to <SAMP>`foo.c'</SAMP> even though <SAMP>`foo.o'</SAMP> exists as well.
However, if all the possible completions end in "ignored" strings,
then they are not ignored.  Ignored extensions do not apply to lists
of completions--those always mention all possible completions.
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<P>
  Normally, a completion command that finds the next character is undetermined
automatically displays a list of all possible completions.  If the variable
<CODE>completion-auto-help</CODE> is set to <CODE>nil</CODE>, this does not happen,
and you must type <KBD>?</KBD> to display the possible completions.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC38">Minibuffer History</A></H2>
<P>
  Every argument that you enter with the minibuffer is saved on a
<DFN>minibuffer history list</DFN> so that you can use it again later in
another argument.  Special commands load the text of an earlier argument
in the minibuffer.  They discard the old minibuffer contents, so you can
think of them as moving through the history of previous arguments.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>M-p</KBD>
<DD>Move to the next earlier argument string saved in the minibuffer history
(<CODE>previous-history-element</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>M-n</KBD>
<DD>Move to the next later argument string saved in the minibuffer history
(<CODE>next-history-element</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>M-r <VAR>regexp</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Move to an earlier saved argument in the minibuffer history that has a
match for <VAR>regexp</VAR> (<CODE>previous-matching-history-element</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>M-s <VAR>regexp</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Move to a later saved argument in the minibuffer history that has a
match for <VAR>regexp</VAR> (<CODE>next-matching-history-element</CODE>).
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
<P>
  The simplest way to reuse the saved arguments in the history list is
to move through the history list one element at a time.  While in the
minibuffer, type <KBD>M-p</KBD> (<CODE>previous-history-element</CODE>) to "move
to" the next earlier minibuffer input, and use <KBD>M-n</KBD>
(<CODE>next-history-element</CODE>) to "move to" the next later input.
<P>
  The previous input that you fetch from the history entirely replaces
the contents of the minibuffer.  To use it as the argument, exit the
minibuffer as usual with <KBD>RET</KBD>.  You can also edit the text before
you reuse it; this does not change the history element that you
"moved" to, but your new argument does go at the end of the history
list in its own right.
<A NAME="IDX159"></A>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
<P>
  There are also commands to search forward or backward through the
history.  As of this writing, they search for history elements that
match a regular expression that you specify with the minibuffer.
<KBD>M-r</KBD> (<CODE>previous-matching-history-element</CODE>) searches older
elements in the history, while <KBD>M-s</KBD>
(<CODE>next-matching-history-element</CODE>) searches newer elements.  By
special dispensation, these commands can use the minibuffer to read
their arguments even though you are already in the minibuffer when you
issue them.
<P>
  All uses of the minibuffer record your input on a history list, but
there are separate history lists for different kinds of input.  For
example, there is a list for file names, used by all the commands that
read file names.  There is a list for arguments of commands like
<CODE>query-replace</CODE>.  There are also very specific history lists,
including one for command names read by <KBD>M-x</KBD> and one for
compilation commands read by <CODE>compile</CODE>.  Finally, there is one
"miscellaneous" history list that most minibuffer arguments use.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX163"></A>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC39">Repeating Minibuffer Commands</A></H2>
<P>
  Every command that uses the minibuffer at least once is recorded on a
special history list, together with the values of their
arguments, so that you can repeat the entire command.  In particular,
every use of <KBD>M-x</KBD> is recorded, since <KBD>M-x</KBD> uses the minibuffer
to read the command name.
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>C-x <KBD>ESC</KBD> <KBD>ESC</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Re-execute a recent minibuffer command <BR>(<CODE>repeat-complex-command</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>M-x list-command-history</KBD>
<DD>Display the entire command history, showing all the commands
<KBD>C-x <KBD>ESC</KBD> <KBD>ESC</KBD></KBD> can repeat, most recent first.
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
<P>
  <KBD>C-x <KBD>ESC</KBD> <KBD>ESC</KBD></KBD> is used to re-execute a recent
minibuffer-using command.  With no argument, it repeats the last such
command.  A numeric argument specifies which command to repeat; one
means the last one, and larger numbers specify earlier ones.
<P>
  <KBD>C-x <KBD>ESC</KBD> <KBD>ESC</KBD></KBD> works by turning the previous command
into a Lisp expression and then entering a minibuffer initialized with
the text for that expression.  If you type just <KBD>RET</KBD>, the command
is repeated as before.  You can also change the command by editing the
Lisp expression.  Whatever expression you finally submit is what will be
executed.  The repeated command is added to the front of the command
history unless it is identical to the most recently executed command
already there.
<P>
  Even if you don't understand Lisp syntax, it will probably be obvious
which command is displayed for repetition.  If you do not change the
text, it will repeat exactly as before.
<P>
  Once inside the minibuffer for <KBD>C-x <KBD>ESC</KBD> <KBD>ESC</KBD></KBD>, you can
use the minibuffer history commands (<KBD>M-p</KBD>, <KBD>M-n</KBD>, <KBD>M-r</KBD>,
<KBD>M-s</KBD>; see section <A HREF="emacs_10.html#SEC38">Minibuffer History</A>) to move through the history list
of saved entire commands.  After finding the desired previous command,
you can edit its expression as usual and then resubmit it by typing
<KBD>RET</KBD> as usual.
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
<P>
  The list of previous minibuffer-using commands is stored as a Lisp
list in the variable <CODE>command-history</CODE>.  Each element is a Lisp
expression which describes one command and its arguments.  Lisp programs
can reexecute a command by calling <CODE>eval</CODE> with the
<CODE>command-history</CODE> element.
