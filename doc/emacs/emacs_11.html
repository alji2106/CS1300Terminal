<TITLE>GNU Emacs Manual - Running Commands by Name</TITLE>

<H1><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC40">Running Commands by Name</A></H1>
<P>
  The Emacs commands that are used often or that must be quick to type are
bound to keys--short sequences of characters--for convenient use.  Other
Emacs commands that do not need to be brief are not bound to keys; to run
them, you must refer to them by name.
<P>
  A command name is, by convention, made up of one or more words,
separated by hyphens; for example, <CODE>auto-fill-mode</CODE> or
<CODE>manual-entry</CODE>.  The use of English words makes the command name
easier to remember than a key made up of obscure characters, even though
it is more characters to type.
<A NAME="IDX169"></A>
<P>
  The way to run a command by name is to start with <KBD>M-x</KBD>, type the
command name, and finish it with <KBD>RET</KBD>.  <KBD>M-x</KBD> uses the
minibuffer to read the command name.  <KBD>RET</KBD> exits the minibuffer and
runs the command.  The string <SAMP>`M-x'</SAMP> appears at the beginning of the
minibuffer as a <DFN>prompt</DFN> to remind you to enter the name of a
command to be run.  See section <A HREF="emacs_10.html#SEC30">The Minibuffer</A>, for full information on the
features of the minibuffer.
<P>
  You can use completion to enter the command name.  For example, the
command <CODE>forward-char</CODE> can be invoked by name by typing
<P>
<PRE>
M-x forward-char <KBD>RET</KBD>

or

M-x fo <KBD>TAB</KBD> c <KBD>RET</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
Note that <CODE>forward-char</CODE> is the same command that you invoke with
the key <KBD>C-f</KBD>.  You can run any Emacs command by its name using
<KBD>M-x</KBD>, whether or not any keys are bound to it.
<P>
  If you type <KBD>C-g</KBD> while the command name is being read, you cancel
the <KBD>M-x</KBD> command and get out of the minibuffer, ending up at top level.
<P>
  To pass a numeric argument to the command you are invoking with
<KBD>M-x</KBD>, specify the numeric argument before the <KBD>M-x</KBD>.  <KBD>M-x</KBD>
passes the argument along to the command it runs.  The argument value
appears in the prompt while the command name is being read.
<P>
  Normally, when describing a command that is run by name, we omit the
<KBD>RET</KBD> that is needed to terminate the name.  Thus we might speak of
<KBD>M-x auto-fill-mode</KBD> rather than <KBD>M-x auto-fill-mode
<KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>.  We mention the <KBD>RET</KBD> only when there is a need to
emphasize its presence, such as when we show the command together with
following arguments.
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
<P>
  <KBD>M-x</KBD> is defined to run the command <CODE>execute-extended-command</CODE>,
which is responsible for reading the name of another command and invoking
it.
