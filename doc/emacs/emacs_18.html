<P>
  In this chapter we describe the commands that are especially useful for
the times when you catch a mistake in your text just after you have made
it, or change your mind while composing text on line.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC92">Killing Your Mistakes</A></H2>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD><KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Delete last character (<CODE>delete-backward-char</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Kill last word (<CODE>backward-kill-word</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>C-x <KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Kill to beginning of sentence (<CODE>backward-kill-sentence</CODE>).
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX392"></A>
<A NAME="IDX393"></A>
<P>
  The <KBD>DEL</KBD> character (<CODE>delete-backward-char</CODE>) is the most
important correction command.  When used among graphic (self-inserting)
characters, it can be thought of as canceling the last character typed.
<A NAME="IDX394"></A>
<A NAME="IDX395"></A>
<A NAME="IDX396"></A>
<A NAME="IDX397"></A>
<P>
  When your mistake is longer than a couple of characters, it might be
more convenient to use <KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> or <KBD>C-x <KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD>.
<KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> kills back to the start of the last word, and <KBD>C-x
<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> kills back to the start of the last sentence.  <KBD>C-x
<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> is particularly useful when you change your mind about the
phrasing of the text you are writing.  <KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> and <KBD>C-x
<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> save the killed text for <KBD>C-y</KBD> and <KBD>M-y</KBD> to
retrieve.  See section <A HREF="emacs_14.html#SEC58">Yanking</A>.<P>
  <KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> is often useful even when you have typed only a few
characters wrong, if you know you are confused in your typing and aren't
sure exactly what you typed.  At such a time, you cannot correct with
<KBD>DEL</KBD> except by looking at the screen to see what you did.  It requires
less thought to kill the whole word and start over again.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC93" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC93">Transposing Text</A></H2>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DD>Transpose two characters (<CODE>transpose-chars</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>M-t</KBD>
<DD>Transpose two words (<CODE>transpose-words</CODE>).

<A NAME="IDX400"></A>
<P>
  The common error of transposing two characters can be fixed, when they
are adjacent, with the <KBD>C-t</KBD> command (<CODE>transpose-chars</CODE>).  Normally,
<KBD>C-t</KBD> transposes the two characters on either side of point.  When
given at the end of a line, rather than transposing the last character of
the line with the newline, which would be useless, <KBD>C-t</KBD> transposes the
last two characters on the line.  So, if you catch your transposition error
right away, you can fix it with just a <KBD>C-t</KBD>.  If you don't catch it so
fast, you must move the cursor back to between the two transposed
characters.  If you transposed a space with the last character of the word
before it, the word motion commands are a good way of getting there.
Otherwise, a reverse search (<KBD>C-r</KBD>) is often the best way.
See section <A HREF="emacs_17.html#SEC77">Searching and Replacement</A>.

<A NAME="IDX406"></A>
<P>
  <KBD>M-t</KBD> (<CODE>transpose-words</CODE>) transposes the word before point
with the word after point.  It moves point forward over a word, dragging
the word preceding or containing point forward as well.  The punctuation
characters between the words do not move.  For example, <SAMP>`FOO, BAR'</SAMP>
transposes into <SAMP>`BAR, FOO'</SAMP> rather than <SAMP>`BAR FOO,'</SAMP>.
<P>
  <KBD>C-M-t</KBD> (<CODE>transpose-sexps</CODE>) is a similar command for transposing
two expressions (see section <A HREF="emacs_26.html#SEC178">Lists and Sexps</A>), and <KBD>C-x C-t</KBD> (<CODE>transpose-lines</CODE>)
exchanges lines.  They work like <KBD>M-t</KBD> except in determining the
division of the text into syntactic units.
<P>
  A numeric argument to a transpose command serves as a repeat count: it
tells the transpose command to move the character (word, sexp, line)
before or containing point across several other characters (words,
sexps, lines).  For example, <KBD>C-u 3 C-t</KBD> moves the character before
point forward across three other characters.  It would change
<SAMP>`f-!-oobar'</SAMP> into <SAMP>`oobf-!-ar'</SAMP>.  This is equivalent to
repeating <KBD>C-t</KBD> three times.  <KBD>C-u - 4 M-t</KBD> moves the word
before point backward across four words.  <KBD>C-u - C-M-t</KBD> would cancel
the effect of plain <KBD>C-M-t</KBD>.<P>
  A numeric argument of zero is assigned a special meaning (because
otherwise a command with a repeat count of zero would do nothing): to
transpose the character (word, sexp, line) ending after point with the
one ending after the mark.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>M-- M-l</KBD>
<DD>Convert last word to lower case.  Note <KBD>Meta--</KBD> is Meta-minus.
<DT><KBD>M-- M-u</KBD>
<DD>Convert last word to all upper case.
<DT><KBD>M-- M-c</KBD>
<DD>Convert last word to lower case with capital initial.

<P>
  A very common error is to type words in the wrong case.  Because of this,
the word case-conversion commands <KBD>M-l</KBD>, <KBD>M-u</KBD> and <KBD>M-c</KBD> have a
special feature when used with a negative argument: they do not move the
cursor.  As soon as you see you have mistyped the last word, you can simply
case-convert it and go on typing.  See section <A HREF="emacs_25.html#SEC164">Case Conversion Commands</A>.<P>

<H2><A NAME="SEC95" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC95">Checking and Correcting Spelling</A></H2>
<P>
  This section describes the commands to check the spelling of a single
word or of a portion of a buffer.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>M-$</KBD>
<DD>Check and correct spelling of word at point (<CODE>ispell-word</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>M-x ispell-buffer</KBD>
<DD>Check and correct spelling of each word in the buffer.
<DT><KBD>M-x ispell-region</KBD>
<DD>Check and correct spelling of each word in the region.
<DT><KBD>M-x ispell-string <KBD>RET</KBD> <VAR>word</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Check spelling of <VAR>word</VAR>.
<DT><KBD>M-x ispell-complete-word</KBD>
<DD>Complete the word before point based on the spelling dictionary.
<DT><KBD>M-x reload-ispell</KBD>
<DD>Make the Ispell subprocess reread your private dictionary.
<DT><KBD>M-x kill-ispell</KBD>
<DD>Kill the Ispell subprocess.
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX418"></A>
<A NAME="IDX419"></A>
<P>
  To check the spelling of the word around or next to point, and
optionally correct it as well, use the command <KBD>M-$</KBD>
(<CODE>ispell-word</CODE>).  If the word is not correct, the command offers
you various alternatives for what to do about it.
<A NAME="IDX420"></A>
<A NAME="IDX421"></A>
<P>
  To check the entire current buffer, use <KBD>M-x ispell-buffer</KBD>.  Use
<KBD>M-x ispell-region</KBD> to check just the current region.  Each time
these commands encounter an incorrect word, they ask you what to do.
<P>
  Whenever one of these commands finds an incorrect word, it displays a
list of alternatives, usually including several "near-misses"---words
that are close to the word being checked.  Here are the valid responses:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD><KBD>SPC</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Skip this word--continue to consider it incorrect, but don't change it
here.
<P>
<DT><KBD>r <VAR>new</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Replace the word (just this time) with <VAR>new</VAR>.
<P>
<DT><KBD><VAR>digit</VAR></KBD>
<DD>Replace the word (just this time) with one of the displayed
near-misses.  Each near-miss is listed with a digit; type that digit to
select it.
<P>
<DT><KBD>a</KBD>
<DD>Accept the incorrect word--treat it as correct, but only in this
editing session.
<P>
<DT><KBD>i</KBD>
<DD>Insert this word in your private dictionary file so that Ispell will
consider it correct it from now on, even in future sessions.
<P>
<DT><KBD>l <VAR>regexp</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Look in the dictionary for words that match <VAR>regexp</VAR>.  These words
become the new list of "near-misses"; you can select one of them to
replace with by typing a digit.
<P>
<DT><KBD>C-g</KBD>
<DD>Quit interactive spell checking.  You can restart it again afterward
with <KBD>C-u M-$</KBD>.
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX422"></A>
<P>
  The command <CODE>ispell-complete-word</CODE>, which is bound to the key
<KBD>M-<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD> in Text mode and related modes, performs completion
based on spelling correction.  Insert the beginning of a word, and then
type <KBD>M-<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>; the command inserts as many more letters as can
be uniquely determined from the letters in the buffer, based on your
currently loaded dictionaries.  See section <A HREF="emacs_25.html#SEC165">Text Mode</A>.
<A NAME="IDX423"></A>
<P>
  The first time you use any of the spell checking commands, it starts
an Ispell subprocess.  The first thing the subprocess does is read your
private dictionary, which is the file <TT>`~/ispell.words'</TT>.  Words that
you "insert" with the <KBD>i</KBD> command are added to that file, but not
right away--only at the end of the interactive replacement procedure.
Use the <KBD>M-x reload-ispell</KBD> command to reload your private
dictionary from <TT>`~/ispell.words'</TT> if you edit the file outside of
Ispell.
<A NAME="IDX424"></A>
<A NAME="IDX425"></A>
<P>
  Once started, the Ispell subprocess continues to run (waiting for
something to do), so that subsequent spell checking commands complete
more quickly.  If you want to get rid of the Ispell process, use
<KBD>M-x kill-ispell</KBD>.  This is not usually necessary, since the process
uses no time except when you do spelling correction.
