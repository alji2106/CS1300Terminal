<P>
  If you want to create a picture made out of text characters (for example,
a picture of the division of a register into fields, as a comment in a
program), use the command <KBD>M-x edit-picture</KBD> to enter Picture mode.
<P>
  In Picture mode, editing is based on the <DFN>quarter-plane</DFN> model of
text, according to which the text characters lie studded on an area that
stretches infinitely far to the right and downward.  The concept of the end
of a line does not exist in this model; the most you can say is where the
last nonblank character on the line is found.
<P>
  Of course, Emacs really always considers text as a sequence of
characters, and lines really do have ends.  But in Picture mode most
frequently-used keys are rebound to commands that simulate the
quarter-plane model of text.  They do this by inserting spaces or by
converting tabs to spaces.
<P>
  Most of the basic editing commands of Emacs are redefined by Picture mode
to do essentially the same thing but in a quarter-plane way.  In addition,
Picture mode defines various keys starting with the <KBD>C-c</KBD> prefix to
run special picture editing commands.
<P>
  One of these keys, <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD>, is pretty important.  Often a
picture is part of a larger file that is usually edited in some other
major mode.  <KBD>M-x edit-picture</KBD> records the name of the previous
major mode so you can use the <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD> command
(<CODE>picture-mode-exit</CODE>) later to go back to that mode.  <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD>
also deletes spaces from the ends of lines, unless given a numeric
argument.
<P>
  The commands used in Picture mode all work in other modes (provided the
<TT>`picture'</TT> library is loaded), but are not bound to keys except in
Picture mode.  Note that the descriptions below talk of moving "one
column" and so on, but all the picture mode commands handle numeric
arguments as their normal equivalents do.
<A NAME="IDX1238"></A>
<P>
  Turning on Picture mode runs the hook <CODE>picture-mode-hook</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="emacs_35.html#SEC337">Hooks</A>).

<P>
  Most keys do the same thing in Picture mode that they usually do, but
do it in a quarter-plane style.  For example, <KBD>C-f</KBD> is rebound to
run <CODE>picture-forward-column</CODE>, a command which moves point one
column to the right, inserting a space if necessary so that the actual
end of the line makes no difference.  <KBD>C-b</KBD> is rebound to run
<CODE>picture-backward-column</CODE>, which always moves point left one
column, converting a tab to multiple spaces if necessary.  <KBD>C-n</KBD> and
<KBD>C-p</KBD> are rebound to run <CODE>picture-move-down</CODE> and
<CODE>picture-move-up</CODE>, which can either insert spaces or convert tabs
as necessary to make sure that point stays in exactly the same column.
<KBD>C-e</KBD> runs <CODE>picture-end-of-line</CODE>, which moves to after the last
nonblank character on the line.  There is no need to change <KBD>C-a</KBD>,
as the choice of screen model does not affect beginnings of
lines.<A NAME="IDX1244"></A>
<P>
  Insertion of text is adapted to the quarter-plane screen model through
the use of Overwrite mode (see section <A HREF="emacs_35.html#SEC333">Minor Modes</A>).  Self-inserting characters
replace existing text, column by column, rather than pushing existing text
to the right.  <KBD>RET</KBD> runs <CODE>picture-newline</CODE>, which just moves to
the beginning of the following line so that new text will replace that
line.
<A NAME="IDX1245"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1246"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1247"></A>
<P>
  Picture mode provides erasure instead of deletion and killing of
text.  <KBD>DEL</KBD> (<CODE>picture-backward-clear-column</CODE>) replaces the
preceding character with a space rather than removing it; this moves
point backwards.  <KBD>C-d</KBD> (<CODE>picture-clear-column</CODE>) replaces the
next character or characters with spaces, but does not move point.  (If
you want to clear characters to spaces and move forward over them, use
<KBD>SPC</KBD>.)  <KBD>C-k</KBD> (<CODE>picture-clear-line</CODE>) really kills the
contents of lines, but does not delete the newlines from the
buffer.
<A NAME="IDX1248"></A>
<P>
  To do actual insertion, you must use special commands.  <KBD>C-o</KBD>
(<CODE>picture-open-line</CODE>) still creates a blank line, but does so after
the current line; it never splits a line.  <KBD>C-M-o</KBD>, <CODE>split-line</CODE>,
makes sense in Picture mode, so it is not changed.  <KBD>LFD</KBD>
(<CODE>picture-duplicate-line</CODE>) inserts below the current line another line
with the same contents.<A NAME="IDX1249"></A>
<P>
  If you want to do real deletion in Picture mode, use <KBD>C-w</KBD>,
<KBD>C-c C-d</KBD> (which is defined as <CODE>delete-char</CODE>, as <KBD>C-d</KBD> is
in other modes), or one of the picture rectangle commands
(see section <A HREF="emacs_29.html#SEC246">Picture Mode Rectangle Commands</A>).

<P>
  Since "self-inserting" characters in Picture mode just overwrite and
move point, there is no essential restriction on how point should be moved.
Normally point moves right, but you can specify any of the eight orthogonal
or diagonal directions for motion after a "self-inserting" character.
This is useful for drawing lines in the buffer.

<P>
  Two motion commands move based on the current Picture insertion
direction.  The command <KBD>C-c C-f</KBD> (<CODE>picture-motion</CODE>) moves in the
same direction as motion after "insertion" currently does, while <KBD>C-c
C-b</KBD> (<CODE>picture-motion-reverse</CODE>) moves in the opposite direction.

<H2><A NAME="SEC245" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC245">Picture Mode Tabs</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX1270"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1271"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1272"></A>
<P>
  Two kinds of tab-like action are provided in Picture mode.  Use
<KBD>M-<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD> (<CODE>picture-tab-search</CODE>) for context-based
tabbing.  With no argument, it moves to a point underneath the next
"interesting" character that follows whitespace in the previous
nonblank line.  "Next" here means "appearing at a horizontal position
greater than the one point starts out at".  With an argument, as in
<KBD>C-u M-<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>, this command moves to the next such interesting
character in the current line.  <KBD>M-<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD> does not change the
text; it only moves point.  "Interesting" characters are defined by
the variable <CODE>picture-tab-chars</CODE>, which contains a string whose
characters are all considered interesting.  Its default value is
<CODE>"!-~"</CODE>.<A NAME="IDX1273"></A>
<P>
  <KBD>TAB</KBD> itself runs <CODE>picture-tab</CODE>, which operates based on the
current tab stop settings; it is the Picture mode equivalent of
<CODE>tab-to-tab-stop</CODE>.  Normally it just moves point, but with a numeric
argument it clears the text that it moves over.
<A NAME="IDX1274"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1275"></A>
<P>
  The context-based and tab-stop-based forms of tabbing are brought
together by the command <KBD>C-c <KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>, <CODE>picture-set-tab-stops</CODE>.
This command sets the tab stops to the positions which <KBD>M-<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>
would consider significant in the current line.  The use of this command,
together with <KBD>TAB</KBD>, can get the effect of context-based tabbing.  But
<KBD>M-<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD> is more convenient in the cases where it is sufficient.

<H2><A NAME="SEC246" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC246">Picture Mode Rectangle Commands</A></H2>
<P>
  Picture mode defines commands for working on rectangular pieces of the
text in ways that fit with the quarter-plane model.  The standard rectangle
commands may also be useful (see section <A HREF="emacs_14.html#SEC63">Rectangles</A>).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>C-c C-k</KBD>
<DD>Clear out the region-rectangle (<CODE>picture-clear-rectangle</CODE>).  With
argument, kill it.
<DT><KBD>C-c C-w <VAR>r</VAR></KBD>
<DD>Similar but save rectangle contents in register <VAR>r</VAR> first
(<CODE>picture-clear-rectangle-to-register</CODE>).
<DT><KBD>C-c C-y</KBD>
<DD>Copy last killed rectangle into the buffer by overwriting, with upper
left corner at point (<CODE>picture-yank-rectangle</CODE>).  With argument,
insert instead.
<DT><KBD>C-c C-x <VAR>r</VAR></KBD>
<DD>Similar, but use the rectangle in register <VAR>r</VAR><BR>
(<CODE>picture-yank-rectangle-from-register</CODE>).

<A NAME="IDX1278"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1279"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1280"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1281"></A>
<P>
  The picture rectangle commands <KBD>C-c C-k</KBD>
(<CODE>picture-clear-rectangle</CODE>) and <KBD>C-c C-w</KBD>
(<CODE>picture-clear-rectangle-to-register</CODE>) differ from the standard
rectangle commands in that they normally clear the rectangle instead of
deleting it; this is analogous with the way <KBD>C-d</KBD> is changed in Picture
mode.<P>
  However, deletion of rectangles can be useful in Picture mode, so these
commands delete the rectangle if given a numeric argument.
<A NAME="IDX1282"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1283"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1284"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1285"></A>
<P>
  The Picture mode commands for yanking rectangles differ from the
standard ones in overwriting instead of inserting.  This is the same way
that Picture mode insertion of other text differs from other modes.
<KBD>C-c C-y</KBD> (<CODE>picture-yank-rectangle</CODE>) inserts (by overwriting)
the rectangle that was most recently killed, while <KBD>C-c C-x</KBD>
(<CODE>picture-yank-rectangle-from-register</CODE>) does likewise for the
rectangle found in a specified register.
