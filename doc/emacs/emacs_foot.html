In some editors,
search-and-replace operations are the only convenient way to make a
single change in the text.

You should not suspend the shell process.
Suspending a subjob of the shell is a completely different matter--that
is normal practice, but you must use the shell to continue the subjob;
this command won't do it.

This
dissociword actually appeared during the Vietnam War, when it was very
appropriate.

The wording here was
careless.  The intention was that nobody would have to pay for
<EM>permission</EM> to use the GNU system.  But the words don't make this
clear, and people often interpret them as saying that copies of GNU
should always be distributed at little or no charge.  That was never the
intent; later on, the manifesto mentions the possibility of companies
providing the service of distribution for a profit.  Subsequently I have
learned to distinguish carefully between "free" in the sense of
freedom and "free" in the sense of price.  Free software is software
that users have the freedom to distribute and change.  Some users may
obtain copies at no charge, while others pay to obtain copies--and if
the funds help support improving the software, so much the better.  The
important thing is that everyone who has a copy has the freedom to
cooperate with others in using it.

This is another place I failed to
distinguish carefully between the two different meanings of "free".
The statement as it stands is not false--you can get copies of GNU
software at no charge, from your friends or over the net.  But it does
suggest the wrong idea.

Several such companies now exist.

The Free Software
Foundation raises most of its funds from a distribution service,
although it is a charity rather than a company.  If <EM>no one</EM>
chooses to obtain copies by ordering the from the FSF, it will be unable
to do its work.  But this does not mean that proprietary restrictions
are justified to force every user to pay.  If a small fraction of all
the users order copies from the FSF, that is sufficient to keep the FSF
afloat.  So we ask users to choose to support us in this way.  Have you
done your part?

A group of
computer companies recently pooled funds to support maintenance of the
GNU C Compiler.
