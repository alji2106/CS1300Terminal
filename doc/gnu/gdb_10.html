Although programming languages generally have common aspects, they are
rarely expressed in the same manner.  For instance, in ANSI C,
dereferencing a pointer <CODE>p</CODE> is accomplished by <CODE>*p</CODE>, but in
Modula-2, it is accomplished by <CODE>p^</CODE>.  Values can also be
represented (and displayed) differently.  Hex numbers in C appear as 
<SAMP>`0x1ae'</SAMP>, while in Modula-2 they appear as <SAMP>`1AEH'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX347"></A>
Language-specific information is built into GDB for some languages,
allowing you to express operations like the above in your program's
native language, and allowing GDB to output values in a manner
consistent with the syntax of your program's native language.  The
language you use to build expressions is called the <STRONG>working
language</STRONG>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC64" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC64">Switching between source languages</A></H2>

<P>
There are two ways to control the working language--either have GDB
set it automatically, or select it manually yourself.  You can use the
<CODE>set language</CODE> command for either purpose.  On startup, GDB
defaults to setting the language automatically.  The working language is
used to determine how expressions you type are interpreted, how values
are printed, etc.

</P>
<P>
In addition to the working language, every source file that
GDB knows about has its own working language.  For some object
file formats, the compiler might indicate which language a particular
source file is in.  However, most of the time GDB infers the
language from the name of the file.  The language of a source file
controls whether C++ names are demangled--this way <CODE>backtrace</CODE> can
show each frame appropriately for its own language.  There is no way to
set the language of a source file from within GDB.  

</P>
<P>
This is most commonly a problem when you use a program, such
as <CODE>cfront</CODE> or <CODE>f2c</CODE>, that generates C but is written in 
another language.  In that case, make the
program use <CODE>#line</CODE> directives in its C output; that way
GDB will know the correct language of the source code of the original
program, and will display that source code, not the generated C code.

<P>
If a source file name ends in one of the following extensions, then
GDB infers that its language is the one indicated.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`.c'</TT>

<DT><TT>`.C'</TT>

<DD>
<DT><TT>`.S'</TT>
<DD>
Assembler source file.  This actually behaves almost like C, but
GDB does not skip over function prologues when stepping.
</DL>

<P>
In addition, you may set the language associated with a filename
extension.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC68">Displaying the language</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC66">Setting the working language</A></H3>

<P>
If you allow GDB to set the language automatically,
expressions are interpreted the same way in your debugging session and
your program.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX348"></A>
If you wish, you may set the language manually.  To do this, issue the
command <SAMP>`set language <VAR>lang</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>lang</VAR> is the name of
a language, such as 
<CODE>c</CODE> or <CODE>modula-2</CODE>.
For a list of the supported languages, type <SAMP>`set language'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Setting the language manually prevents GDB from updating the working
language automatically.  This can lead to confusion if you try
to debug a program when the working language is not the same as the
source language, when an expression is acceptable to both
languages--but means different things.  For instance, if the current
source file were written in C, and GDB was parsing Modula-2, a
command such as:

</P>

<PRE>
print a = b + c
</PRE>

<P>
might not have the effect you intended.  In C, this means to add
<CODE>b</CODE> and <CODE>c</CODE> and place the result in <CODE>a</CODE>.  The result
printed would be the value of <CODE>a</CODE>.  In Modula-2, this means to compare
<CODE>a</CODE> to the result of <CODE>b+c</CODE>, yielding a <CODE>BOOLEAN</CODE> value.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC67" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC67">Having GDB infer the source language</A></H3>

<P>
To have GDB set the working language automatically, use
<SAMP>`set language local'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`set language auto'</SAMP>.  GDB
then infers the working language.  That is, when your program stops in a
frame (usually by encountering a breakpoint), GDB sets the
working language to the language recorded for the function in that
frame.  If the language for a frame is unknown (that is, if the function
or block corresponding to the frame was defined in a source file that
does not have a recognized extension), the current working language is
not changed, and GDB issues a warning.

</P>
<P>
This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written
entirely in one source language.  However, program modules and libraries
written in one source language can be used by a main program written in
a different source language.  Using <SAMP>`set language auto'</SAMP> in this
case frees you from having to set the working language manually.

</P>

<H2><A NAME="SEC69" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC69">Type and range checking</A></H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> In this release, the GDB commands for type and range
checking are included, but they do not yet have any effect.  This
section documents the intended facilities.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Some languages are designed to guard you against making seemingly common
errors through a series of compile- and run-time checks.  These include
checking the type of arguments to functions and operators, and making
sure mathematical overflows are caught at run time.  Checks such as
these help to ensure a program's correctness once it has been compiled
by eliminating type mismatches, and providing active checks for range
errors when your program is running.

</P>
<P>
GDB can check for conditions like the above if you wish.
Although GDB does not check the statements in your program, it
can check expressions entered directly into GDB for evaluation via
the <CODE>print</CODE> command, for example.  As with the working language,
GDB can also decide whether or not to check automatically based on
your program's source language.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>,
for the default settings of supported languages.

<H3><A NAME="SEC70" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC70">An overview of type checking</A></H3>

<P>
Some languages, such as Modula-2, are strongly typed, meaning that the
arguments to operators and functions have to be of the correct type,
otherwise an error occurs.  These checks prevent type mismatch
errors from ever causing any run-time problems.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
1 + 2 => 3
but
error--> 1 + 2.3
</PRE>

<P>
The second example fails because the <CODE>CARDINAL</CODE> 1 is not
type-compatible with the <CODE>REAL</CODE> 2.3.

</P>
<P>
For the expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell the 
GDB type checker to skip checking; 
to treat any mismatches as errors and abandon the expression; 
or to only issue warnings when type mismatches occur, 
but evaluate the expression anyway.  When you choose the last of
these, GDB evaluates expressions like the second example above, but
also issues a warning.

</P>
<P>
Even if you turn type checking off, there may be other reasons 
related to type that prevent GDB from evaluating an expression.  
For instance, GDB does not know how to add an <CODE>int</CODE> and 
a <CODE>struct foo</CODE>.  These particular type errors have nothing to do 
with the language in use, and usually arise from expressions, such as 
the one described above, which make little sense to evaluate anyway.

</P>
<P>
Each language defines to what degree it is strict about type.  For
instance, both Modula-2 and C require the arguments to arithmetical
operators to be numbers.  In C, enumerated types and pointers can be
represented as numbers, so that they are valid arguments to mathematical
operators.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>, for further
details on specific languages.

</P>
<P>
GDB provides some additional commands for controlling the type checker:

<A NAME="IDX356"></A>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set check type auto</CODE>
<DD>
Set type checking on or off based on the current working language.
See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>, for the default settings for
each language.

<DT><CODE>set check type on</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>set check type off</CODE>
<DD>
Set type checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the
current working language.  Issue a warning if the setting does not
match the language default.  If any type mismatches occur in
evaluating an expression while typechecking is on, GDB prints a
message and aborts evaluation of the expression.

<DT><CODE>set check type warn</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the type checker to issue warnings, but to always attempt to
evaluate the expression.  Evaluating the expression may still
be impossible for other reasons.  For example, GDB cannot add
numbers and structures.

<DT><CODE>show type</CODE>
<DD>
Show the current setting of the type checker, and whether or not GDB 
is setting it automatically.
</DL>

<A NAME="IDX359"></A>
<A NAME="IDX360"></A>


<H3><A NAME="SEC71" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC71">An overview of range checking</A></H3>

<P>
In some languages (such as Modula-2), it is an error to exceed the
bounds of a type; this is enforced with run-time checks.  Such range
checking is meant to ensure program correctness by making sure
computations do not overflow, or indices on an array element access do
not exceed the bounds of the array.

</P>
<P>
For expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell
GDB to treat range errors in one of three ways: ignore them,
always treat them as errors and abandon the expression, or issue
warnings but evaluate the expression anyway.

</P>
<P>
A range error can result from numerical overflow, from exceeding an
array index bound, or when you type a constant that is not a member
of any type.  Some languages, however, do not treat overflows as an
error.  In many implementations of C, mathematical overflow causes the
result to "wrap around" to lower values--for example, if <VAR>m</VAR> is
the largest integer value, and <VAR>s</VAR> is the smallest, then

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>m</VAR> + 1 => <VAR>s</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
This, too, is specific to individual languages, and in some cases
specific to individual compilers or machines.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>, for further details on specific languages.

<DD>
Set range checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the

match the language default.  If a range error occurs, then a message
is printed and evaluation of the expression is aborted.

<DT><CODE>set check range warn</CODE>
<DD>
Output messages when the GDB range checker detects a range error,
but attempt to evaluate the expression anyway.  Evaluating the
expression may still be impossible for other reasons, such as accessing
memory that the process does not own (a typical example from many Unix
systems).

<DT><CODE>show range</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC72">Supported languages</A></H2>

<P>
GDB supports C, C++, Fortran, Chill, assembly, and Modula-2.
Some GDB features may be used in expressions regardless of the
language you use: the GDB <CODE>@</CODE> and <CODE>::</CODE> operators,
and the <SAMP>`{type}addr'</SAMP> construct (see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>) can be used with the constructs of any supported
language.

</P>
<P>
The following sections detail to what degree each source language is
supported by GDB.  These sections are not meant to be language
tutorials or references, but serve only as a reference guide to what the
GDB expression parser accepts, and what input and output
formats should look like for different languages.  There are many good
books written on each of these languages; please look to these for a
language reference or tutorial.

The C++ debugging facilities are jointly implemented by the C++
compiler and GDB.  Therefore, to debug your C++ code
effectively, you must compile your C++ programs with a supported
C++ compiler, such as GNU <CODE>g++</CODE>, or the HP ANSI C++
compiler (<CODE>aCC</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
For best results when using GNU C++, use the stabs debugging
format.  You can select that format explicitly with the <CODE>g++</CODE>

<H4><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC75">C and C++ constants</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX370"></A>
GDB allows you to express the constants of C and C++ in the
following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Integer constants are a sequence of digits.  Octal constants are
specified by a leading <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> (i.e. zero), and hexadecimal constants by
a leading <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`0X'</SAMP>.  Constants may also end with a letter
<SAMP>`l'</SAMP>, specifying that the constant should be treated as a
<CODE>long</CODE> value.

<LI>

Floating point constants are a sequence of digits, followed by a decimal
point, followed by a sequence of digits, and optionally followed by an
exponent.  An exponent is of the form:
<SAMP>`e[[+]|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>nnn</VAR> is another
sequence of digits.  The <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> is optional for positive exponents.

<LI>

Enumerated constants consist of enumerated identifiers, or their
integral equivalents.

<LI>

Character constants are a single character surrounded by single quotes
(<CODE>'</CODE>), or a number--the ordinal value of the corresponding character
(usually its ASCII value).  Within quotes, the single character may
be represented by a letter or by <STRONG>escape sequences</STRONG>, which are of
the form <SAMP>`\<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>nnn</VAR> is the octal representation
of the character's ordinal value; or of the form <SAMP>`\<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP>, where
<SAMP>`<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP> is a predefined special character--for example,
<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP> for newline.

<LI>

String constants are a sequence of character constants surrounded
by double quotes (<CODE>"</CODE>).

<LI>

Pointer constants are an integral value.  You can also write pointers
to constants using the C operator <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP>.

<LI>

Array constants are comma-separated lists surrounded by braces <SAMP>`{'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>; for example, <SAMP>`{1,2,3}'</SAMP> is a three-element array of
integers, <SAMP>`{{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}}'</SAMP> is a three-by-two array,
and <SAMP>`{&#38;"hi", &#38;"there", &#38;"fred"}'</SAMP> is a three-element array of pointers.

<EM>Warning:</EM> GDB can only debug C++ code if you use the
proper compiler.  Typically, C++ debugging depends on the use of
additional debugging information in the symbol table, and thus requires
special support.  In particular, if your compiler generates a.out, MIPS
ECOFF, RS/6000 XCOFF, or ELF with stabs extensions to the
symbol table, these facilities are all available.  (With GNU CC,
you can use the <SAMP>`-gstabs'</SAMP> option to request stabs debugging
extensions explicitly.)  Where the object code format is standard
COFF or DWARF in ELF, on the other hand, most of the C++
support in GDB does <EM>not</EM> work.

</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX382"></A>
<A NAME="IDX383"></A>

While a member function is active (in the selected stack frame), your
expressions have the same namespace available as the member function;
that is, GDB allows implicit references to the class instance
pointer <CODE>this</CODE> following the same rules as C++.

<A NAME="IDX384"></A>
<A NAME="IDX385"></A>
<LI>

You can call overloaded functions; GDB resolves the function
call to the right definition, with one restriction--you must use
arguments of the type required by the function that you want to call.
GDB does not perform conversions requiring constructors or
user-defined type operators.

<A NAME="IDX386"></A>
<LI>

GDB understands variables declared as C++ references; you can use 
them in expressions just as you do in C++ source--they are automatically
dereferenced.

In the parameter list shown when GDB displays a frame, the values of
reference variables are not displayed (unlike other variables); this
avoids clutter, since references are often used for large structures.
The <EM>address</EM> of a reference variable is always shown, unless
you have specified <SAMP>`set print address off'</SAMP>.

<LI>

GDB supports the C++ name resolution operator <CODE>::</CODE>---your
expressions can use it just as expressions in your program do.  Since
one scope may be defined in another, you can use <CODE>::</CODE> repeatedly if
necessary, for example in an expression like
<SAMP>`<VAR>scope1</VAR>::<VAR>scope2</VAR>::<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>.  GDB also allows
resolving name scope by reference to source files, in both C and C++
debugging (see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC53">Program variables</A>).

<H4><A NAME="SEC84" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC84">Constants</A></H4>

<P>
GDB allows you to express the constants of Modula-2 in the following
ways:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Integer constants are simply a sequence of digits.  When used in an
expression, a constant is interpreted to be type-compatible with the
rest of the expression.  Hexadecimal integers are specified by a
trailing <SAMP>`H'</SAMP>, and octal integers by a trailing <SAMP>`B'</SAMP>.

<LI>

Floating point constants appear as a sequence of digits, followed by a
decimal point and another sequence of digits.  An optional exponent can
then be specified, in the form <SAMP>`E[+|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where
<SAMP>`[+|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP> is the desired exponent.  All of the
digits of the floating point constant must be valid decimal (base 10)
digits.

<LI>

Character constants consist of a single character enclosed by a pair of
like quotes, either single (<CODE>'</CODE>) or double (<CODE>"</CODE>).  They may
also be expressed by their ordinal value (their ASCII value, usually)
followed by a <SAMP>`C'</SAMP>.

<LI>

String constants consist of a sequence of characters enclosed by a
pair of like quotes, either single (<CODE>'</CODE>) or double (<CODE>"</CODE>).
Escape sequences in the style of C are also allowed.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC75">C and C++ constants</A>, for a brief explanation of escape
sequences.

<LI>

Enumerated constants consist of an enumerated identifier.

<LI>

Boolean constants consist of the identifiers <CODE>TRUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FALSE</CODE>.

<LI>

Pointer constants consist of integral values only.

<LI>

Set constants are not yet supported.

<LI>

Unlike in standard Modula-2, pointer constants can be formed by
integers.  This allows you to modify pointer variables during
debugging.  (In standard Modula-2, the actual address contained in a
pointer variable is hidden from you; it can only be modified
through direct assignment to another pointer variable or expression that
returned a pointer.)

<LI>

C escape sequences can be used in strings and characters to represent
non-printable characters.  GDB prints out strings with these
escape sequences embedded.  Single non-printable characters are
printed using the <SAMP>`CHR(<VAR>nnn</VAR>)'</SAMP> format.

<LI>

The assignment operator (<CODE>:=</CODE>) returns the value of its right-hand
argument.

<LI>

All built-in procedures both modify <EM>and</EM> return their argument.

There are a few subtle differences between the Modula-2 scope operator
(<CODE>.</CODE>) and the GDB scope operator (<CODE>::</CODE>).  The two have

</P>

<PRE>

<VAR>module</VAR> . <VAR>id</VAR>
<VAR>scope</VAR> :: <VAR>id</VAR>

where <VAR>scope</VAR> is the name of a module or a procedure,
<VAR>module</VAR> the name of a module, and <VAR>id</VAR> is any declared
identifier within your program, except another module.

</P>
<P>
Using the <CODE>::</CODE> operator makes GDB search the scope
specified by <VAR>scope</VAR> for the identifier <VAR>id</VAR>.  If it is not
found in the specified scope, then GDB searches all scopes
enclosing the one specified by <VAR>scope</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
Using the <CODE>.</CODE> operator makes GDB search the current scope for
the identifier specified by <VAR>id</VAR> that was imported from the

an error if the identifier <VAR>id</VAR> was not imported from definition

<P>
Some GDB commands have little use when debugging Modula-2 programs.
Five subcommands of <CODE>set print</CODE> and <CODE>show print</CODE> apply
specifically to C and C++: <SAMP>`vtbl'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`demangle'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`asm-demangle'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`object'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`union'</SAMP>.  The first four
apply to C++, and the last to the C <CODE>union</CODE> type, which has no direct
analogue in Modula-2.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>@</CODE> operator (see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>), while available
while using any language, is not useful with Modula-2.  Its
intent is to aid the debugging of <STRONG>dynamic arrays</STRONG>, which cannot be
created in Modula-2 as they can in C or C++.  However, because an
address can be specified by an integral constant, the construct
<SAMP>`{<VAR>type</VAR>}<VAR>adrexp</VAR>'</SAMP> is still useful.  (see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>)

In GDB scripts, the Modula-2 inequality operator <CODE>#</CODE> is
interpreted as the beginning of a comment.  Use <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE> instead.
