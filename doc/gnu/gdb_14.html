A <STRONG>target</STRONG> is the execution environment occupied by your program.
Often, GDB runs in the same host environment as your program; in
that case, the debugging target is specified as a side effect when you
use the <CODE>file</CODE> or <CODE>core</CODE> commands.  When you need more
flexibility--for example, running GDB on a physically separate
host, or controlling a standalone system over a serial port or a
realtime system over a TCP/IP connection--you 
can use the <CODE>target</CODE> command to specify one of the target types
configured for GDB (see section <A HREF="gdb_14.html#SEC103">Commands for managing targets</A>).

<P>

<A NAME="IDX470"></A>
<A NAME="IDX471"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are three classes of targets: processes, core files, and
executable files.  GDB can work concurrently on up to three active
targets, one in each class.  This allows you to (for example) start a
process and inspect its activity without abandoning your work on a core
file.

</P>
<P>
For example, if you execute <SAMP>`gdb a.out'</SAMP>, then the executable file
<CODE>a.out</CODE> is the only active target.  If you designate a core file as
well--presumably from a prior run that crashed and coredumped--then
GDB has two active targets and uses them in tandem, looking
first in the corefile target, then in the executable file, to satisfy
requests for memory addresses.  (Typically, these two classes of target
are complementary, since core files contain only a program's
read-write memory--variables and so on--plus machine status, while
executable files contain only the program text and initialized data.)

</P>
<P>
When you type <CODE>run</CODE>, your executable file becomes an active process
target as well.  When a process target is active, all GDB commands
requesting memory addresses refer to that target; addresses in an 
active core file or 
executable file target are obscured while the process
target is active.

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>core-file</CODE> and <CODE>exec-file</CODE> commands to select a
new core file or executable target (see section <A HREF="gdb_13.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>).  To specify as a target a process that is already running, use
the <CODE>attach</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="gdb_5.html#SEC22">Debugging an already-running process</A>).

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>target <VAR>type</VAR> <VAR>parameters</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Connects the GDB host environment to a target
machine or process.  A target is typically a protocol for talking to
debugging facilities.  You use the argument <VAR>type</VAR> to specify the
type or protocol of the target machine.

Further <VAR>parameters</VAR> are interpreted by the target protocol, but
typically include things like device names or host names to connect
with, process numbers, and baud rates.

The <CODE>target</CODE> command does not repeat if you press <KBD>RET</KBD> again
after executing the command.

<A NAME="IDX472"></A>
<DT><CODE>help target</CODE>
<DD>
Displays the names of all targets available.  To display targets
currently selected, use either <CODE>info target</CODE> or <CODE>info files</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gdb_13.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>).

<DT><CODE>help target <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Describe a particular target, including any parameters necessary to
select it.

<A NAME="IDX473"></A>
<DT><CODE>set gnutarget <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
GDB uses its own library BFD to read your files.  GDB 
knows whether it is reading an <STRONG>executable</STRONG>,
a <STRONG>core</STRONG>, or a <STRONG>.o</STRONG> file; however, you can specify the file format 
with the <CODE>set gnutarget</CODE> command.  Unlike most <CODE>target</CODE> commands, 
with <CODE>gnutarget</CODE> the <CODE>target</CODE> refers to a program, not a machine.

<EM>Warning:</EM> To specify a file format with <CODE>set gnutarget</CODE>,
you must know the actual BFD name.

See section <A HREF="gdb_13.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>.

<A NAME="IDX474"></A>
<DT><CODE>show gnutarget</CODE>
<DD>
Use the <CODE>show gnutarget</CODE> command to display what file format
<CODE>gnutarget</CODE> is set to read.  If you have not set <CODE>gnutarget</CODE>,
GDB will determine the file format for each file automatically,
and <CODE>show gnutarget</CODE> displays <SAMP>`The current BDF target is "auto"'</SAMP>.
</DL>

<P>
Here are some common targets (available, or not, depending on the GDB
configuration):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>target exec <VAR>program</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX475"></A>
 
An executable file.  <SAMP>`target exec <VAR>program</VAR>'</SAMP> is the same as
<SAMP>`exec-file <VAR>program</VAR>'</SAMP>.

specifies what serial device to use for the connection (e.g.
<TT>`/dev/ttya'</TT>). See section <A HREF="gdb_14.html#SEC105">Remote debugging</A>.  <CODE>target remote</CODE>
now supports the <CODE>load</CODE> command.  This is only useful if you have
some other way of getting the stub to the target system, and you can put
it somewhere in memory where it won't get clobbered by the download.

</DL>

<P>
Different targets are available on different configurations of GDB; 
your configuration may have more or fewer targets.

</P>
<P>
Many remote targets require you to download the executable's code
once you've successfully established a connection.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>load <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX516"></A>
 
Depending on what remote debugging facilities are configured into
GDB, the <CODE>load</CODE> command may be available.  Where it exists, it
is meant to make <VAR>filename</VAR> (an executable) available for debugging
on the remote system--by downloading, or dynamic linking, for example.
<CODE>load</CODE> also records the <VAR>filename</VAR> symbol table in GDB, like
the <CODE>add-symbol-file</CODE> command.

If your GDB does not have a <CODE>load</CODE> command, attempting to
execute it gets the error message "<CODE>You can't do that when your
target is ...</CODE>"

The file is loaded at whatever address is specified in the executable.
For some object file formats, you can specify the load address when you
link the program; for other formats, like a.out, the object file format
specifies a fixed address.

On VxWorks, <CODE>load</CODE> links <VAR>filename</VAR> dynamically on the
current target system as well as adding its symbols in GDB.

<A NAME="IDX517"></A>
With the Nindy interface to an Intel 960 board, <CODE>load</CODE>
downloads <VAR>filename</VAR> to the 960 as well as adding its symbols in
GDB.

<A NAME="IDX518"></A>
<A NAME="IDX519"></A>
<A NAME="IDX520"></A>
<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
When you select remote debugging to a Hitachi SH, H8/300, or H8/500 board
(see section <A HREF="gdb_14.html#SEC132">GDB and Hitachi microprocessors</A>),
the <CODE>load</CODE> command downloads your program to the Hitachi board and also
opens it as the current executable target for GDB on your host
(like the <CODE>file</CODE> command).

<CODE>load</CODE> does not repeat if you press <KBD>RET</KBD> again after using it.

<P>
Some types of processors, such as the MIPS, PowerPC, and Hitachi SH,
offer the ability to run either big-endian or little-endian byte
orders.  Usually the executable or symbol will include a bit to
designate the endian-ness, and you will not need to worry about
which to use.  However, you may still find it useful to adjust
GDB's idea of processor endian-ness manually.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set endian big</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
 
Instruct GDB to assume the target is big-endian.

<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
<DT><CODE>set endian little</CODE>
<DD>
Instruct GDB to assume the target is little-endian.

<A NAME="IDX530"></A>
<DT><CODE>set endian auto</CODE>
<DD>
Instruct GDB to use the byte order associated with the
executable.

<DT><CODE>show endian</CODE>
<DD>
Display GDB's current idea of the target byte order.

</DL>

<P>
Note that these commands merely adjust interpretation of symbolic
data on the host, and that they have absolutely no effect on the
target system.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX531"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are trying to debug a program running on a machine that cannot run
GDB in the usual way, it is often useful to use remote debugging.  
For example, you might use remote debugging on an operating system kernel, 
or on a small system which does not have a general purpose operating system
powerful enough to run a full-featured debugger.

</P>
<P>
Some configurations of GDB have special serial or TCP/IP interfaces
to make this work with particular debugging targets.  In addition,
GDB comes with a generic serial protocol (specific to GDB, 
but not specific to any particular target system) which you can use if you
write the remote stubs--the code that runs on the remote system to
communicate with GDB.

</P>
<P>
Other remote targets may be available in your
configuration of GDB; use <CODE>help target</CODE> to list them.

<A NAME="IDX532"></A>
To debug a program running on another machine (the debugging
<STRONG>target</STRONG> machine), you must first arrange for all the usual
prerequisites for the program to run by itself.  For example, for a C
program, you need:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

A startup routine to set up the C runtime environment; these usually
have a name like <TT>`crt0'</TT>.  The startup routine may be supplied by
your hardware supplier, or you may have to write your own.

<LI>

You probably need a C subroutine library to support your program's
subroutine calls, notably managing input and output.

<LI>

A way of getting your program to the other machine--for example, a
download program.  These are often supplied by the hardware
manufacturer, but you may have to write your own from hardware
documentation.
</OL>

<P>
The next step is to arrange for your program to use a serial port to
communicate with the machine where GDB is running (the <STRONG>host</STRONG>
machine).  In general terms, the scheme looks like this:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>On the host,</EM>
<DD>
GDB already understands how to use this protocol; when everything
else is set up, you can simply use the <SAMP>`target remote'</SAMP> command
(see section <A HREF="gdb_14.html#SEC101">Specifying a Debugging Target</A>).

<DT><EM>On the target,</EM>
<DD>
you must link with your program a few special-purpose subroutines that
implement the GDB remote serial protocol.  The file containing these
subroutines is called  a <STRONG>debugging stub</STRONG>.

On certain remote targets, you can use an auxiliary program
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> instead of linking a stub into your program.
See section <A HREF="gdb_14.html#SEC111">Using the <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> program</A>, for details.
</DL>

<P>
The debugging stub is specific to the architecture of the remote
machine; for example, use <TT>`sparc-stub.c'</TT> to debug programs on
SPARC boards.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX548"></A>
The debugging stub for your architecture supplies these three
subroutines:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set_debug_traps</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX549"></A>
<A NAME="IDX550"></A>
This routine arranges for <CODE>handle_exception</CODE> to run when your
program stops.  You must call this subroutine explicitly near the
beginning of your program.

<DT><CODE>handle_exception</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX551"></A>
<A NAME="IDX552"></A>
This is the central workhorse, but your program never calls it
explicitly--the setup code arranges for <CODE>handle_exception</CODE> to
run when a trap is triggered.

<CODE>handle_exception</CODE> takes control when your program stops during
execution (for example, on a breakpoint), and mediates communications
with GDB on the host machine.  This is where the communications
protocol is implemented; <CODE>handle_exception</CODE> acts as the GDB
representative on the target machine; it begins by sending summary
information on the state of your program, then continues to execute,
retrieving and transmitting any information GDB needs, until you
execute a GDB command that makes your program resume; at that point,
<CODE>handle_exception</CODE> returns control to your own code on the target
machine. 

<DT><CODE>breakpoint</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX553"></A>
Use this auxiliary subroutine to make your program contain a
breakpoint.  Depending on the particular situation, this may be the only
way for GDB to get control.  For instance, if your target
machine has some sort of interrupt button, you won't need to call this;
pressing the interrupt button transfers control to
<CODE>handle_exception</CODE>---in effect, to GDB.  On some machines,
simply receiving characters on the serial port may also trigger a trap;
again, in that situation, you don't need to call <CODE>breakpoint</CODE> from
your own program--simply running <SAMP>`target remote'</SAMP> from the host
GDB session gets control.  

Call <CODE>breakpoint</CODE> if none of these is true, or if you simply want
to make certain your program stops at a predetermined point for the
start of your debugging session.

<H4><A NAME="SEC108" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC108">What you must do for the stub</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX554"></A>
The debugging stubs that come with GDB are set up for a particular
chip architecture, but they have no information about the rest of your
debugging target machine.

</P>
<P>
First of all you need to tell the stub how to communicate with the
serial port.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>int getDebugChar()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
Write this subroutine to read a single character from the serial port.
It may be identical to <CODE>getchar</CODE> for your target system; a
different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.

<DT><CODE>void putDebugChar(int)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX556"></A>
Write this subroutine to write a single character to the serial port.
It may be identical to <CODE>putchar</CODE> for your target system; a 
different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX557"></A>
<A NAME="IDX558"></A>
If you want GDB to be able to stop your program while it is
running, you need to use an interrupt-driven serial driver, and arrange
for it to stop when it receives a <CODE>^C</CODE> (<SAMP>`\003'</SAMP>, the control-C
character).  That is the character which GDB uses to tell the
remote system to stop.

</P>
<P>
Getting the debugging target to return the proper status to GDB
probably requires changes to the standard stub; one quick and dirty way
is to just execute a breakpoint instruction (the "dirty" part is that
GDB reports a <CODE>SIGTRAP</CODE> instead of a <CODE>SIGINT</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
Other routines you need to supply are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>void exceptionHandler (int <VAR>exception_number</VAR>, void *<VAR>exception_address</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX559"></A>
Write this function to install <VAR>exception_address</VAR> in the exception
handling tables.  You need to do this because the stub does not have any
way of knowing what the exception handling tables on your target system
are like (for example, the processor's table might be in ROM,
containing entries which point to a table in RAM).
<VAR>exception_number</VAR> is the exception number which should be changed;
its meaning is architecture-dependent (for example, different numbers
might represent divide by zero, misaligned access, etc).  When this
exception occurs, control should be transferred directly to
<VAR>exception_address</VAR>, and the processor state (stack, registers,
and so on) should be just as it is when a processor exception occurs.  So if
you want to use a jump instruction to reach <VAR>exception_address</VAR>, it
should be a simple jump, not a jump to subroutine.

For the 386, <VAR>exception_address</VAR> should be installed as an interrupt
gate so that interrupts are masked while the handler runs.  The gate
should be at privilege level 0 (the most privileged level).  The
SPARC and 68k stubs are able to mask interrup themselves without
help from <CODE>exceptionHandler</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>void flush_i_cache()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX560"></A>
(sparc and sparclite only) Write this subroutine to flush the
instruction cache, if any, on your target machine.  If there is no
instruction cache, this subroutine may be a no-op.

On target machines that have instruction caches, GDB requires this
function to make certain that the state of your program is stable.
</DL>

<P>
You must also make sure this library routine is available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>void *memset(void *, int, int)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX561"></A>
This is the standard library function <CODE>memset</CODE> that sets an area of
memory to a known value.  If you have one of the free versions of
<CODE>libc.a</CODE>, <CODE>memset</CODE> can be found there; otherwise, you must
either obtain it from your hardware manufacturer, or write your own.
</DL>

<P>
If you do not use the GNU C compiler, you may need other standard
library subroutines as well; this varies from one stub to another,
but in general the stubs are likely to use any of the common library
subroutines which <CODE>gcc</CODE> generates as inline code.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC109" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC109">Putting it all together</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX562"></A>
In summary, when your program is ready to debug, you must follow these
steps.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make sure you have the supporting low-level routines
(see section <A HREF="gdb_14.html#SEC108">What you must do for the stub</A>):

<PRE>
<CODE>getDebugChar</CODE>, <CODE>putDebugChar</CODE>,
<CODE>flush_i_cache</CODE>, <CODE>memset</CODE>, <CODE>exceptionHandler</CODE>.
</PRE>

<LI>

Insert these lines near the top of your program:


<PRE>
set_debug_traps();
breakpoint();
</PRE>

<LI>

For the 680x0 stub only, you need to provide a variable called
<CODE>exceptionHook</CODE>.  Normally you just use:


<PRE>
void (*exceptionHook)() = 0;
</PRE>

but if before calling <CODE>set_debug_traps</CODE>, you set it to point to a
function in your program, that function is called when
<CODE>GDB</CODE> continues after stopping on a trap (for example, bus
error).  The function indicated by <CODE>exceptionHook</CODE> is called with
one parameter: an <CODE>int</CODE> which is the exception number.

<LI>

Compile and link together: your program, the GDB debugging stub for
your target architecture, and the supporting subroutines.

<LI>

Make sure you have a serial connection between your target machine and
the GDB host, and identify the serial port on the host.

<LI>

Download your program to your target machine (or get it there by
whatever means the manufacturer provides), and start it.

<LI>

To start remote debugging, run GDB on the host machine, and specify
as an executable file the program that is running in the remote machine.
This tells GDB how to find your program's symbols and the contents
of its pure text.

<A NAME="IDX563"></A>
Then establish communication using the <CODE>target remote</CODE> command.
Its argument specifies how to communicate with the target
machine--either via a devicename attached to a direct serial line, or a
TCP port (usually to a terminal server which in turn has a serial line
to the target).  For example, to use a serial line connected to the
device named <TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT>:


<PRE>
target remote /dev/ttyb
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX564"></A>
To use a TCP connection, use an argument of the form
<CODE><VAR>host</VAR>:port</CODE>.  For example, to connect to port 2828 on a
terminal server named <CODE>manyfarms</CODE>:


<PRE>
target remote manyfarms:2828
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
Now you can use all the usual commands to examine and change data and to
step and continue the remote program.

</P>
<P>
To resume the remote program and stop debugging it, use the <CODE>detach</CODE>
command.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX565"></A>
<A NAME="IDX566"></A>
Whenever GDB is waiting for the remote program, if you type the
interrupt character (often <KBD>C-C</KBD>), GDB attempts to stop the
program.  This may or may not succeed, depending in part on the hardware
and the serial drivers the remote system uses.  If you type the
interrupt character once again, GDB displays this prompt:

</P>

<PRE>
Interrupted while waiting for the program.
Give up (and stop debugging it)?  (y or n)
</PRE>

<P>
If you type <KBD>y</KBD>, GDB abandons the remote debugging session.
(If you decide you want to try again later, you can use <SAMP>`target
remote'</SAMP> again to connect once more.)  If you type <KBD>n</KBD>, GDB
goes back to waiting.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC110" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC110">Communication protocol</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX567"></A>
<A NAME="IDX568"></A>
<A NAME="IDX569"></A>
The stub files provided with GDB implement the target side of the
communication protocol, and the GDB side is implemented in the
GDB source file <TT>`remote.c'</TT>.  Normally, you can simply allow
these subroutines to communicate, and ignore the details.  (If you're
implementing your own stub file, you can still ignore the details: start
with one of the existing stub files.  <TT>`sparc-stub.c'</TT> is the best
organized, and therefore the easiest to read.)

</P>
<P>
However, there may be occasions when you need to know something about
the protocol--for example, if there is only one serial port to your
target machine, you might want your program to do something special if
it recognizes a packet meant for GDB.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX570"></A>
<A NAME="IDX571"></A>
<A NAME="IDX572"></A>
All GDB commands and responses (other than acknowledgements, which
are single characters) are sent as a packet which includes a
checksum.  A packet is introduced with the character <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>, and ends
with the character <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> followed by a two-digit checksum:

</P>

<PRE>
$<VAR>packet info</VAR>#<VAR>checksum</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX573"></A>
<VAR>checksum</VAR> is computed as the modulo 256 sum of the <VAR>packet
info</VAR> characters.

</P>
<P>
When either the host or the target machine receives a packet, the first
response expected is an acknowledgement: a single character, either
<SAMP>`+'</SAMP> (to indicate the package was received correctly) or <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>
(to request retransmission).

</P>
<P>
The host (GDB) sends commands, and the target (the debugging stub
incorporated in your program) sends data in response.  The target also
sends data when your program stops.

</P>
<P>
Command packets are distinguished by their first character, which
identifies the kind of command.

</P>
<P>
These are some of the commands currently supported (for a complete list of

<H4><A NAME="SEC111" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC111">Using the <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> program</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
<A NAME="IDX579"></A>
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> is a control program for Unix-like systems, which
allows you to connect your program with a remote GDB via
<CODE>target remote</CODE>---but without linking in the usual debugging stub.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> is not a complete replacement for the debugging stubs,
because it requires essentially the same operating-system facilities
that GDB itself does.  In fact, a system that can run
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> to connect to a remote GDB could also run
GDB locally!  <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> is sometimes useful nevertheless,
because it is a much smaller program than GDB itself.  It is
also easier to port than all of GDB, so you may be able to get
started more quickly on a new system by using <CODE>gdbserver</CODE>.
Finally, if you develop code for real-time systems, you may find that
the tradeoffs involved in real-time operation make it more convenient to
do as much development work as possible on another system, for example
by cross-compiling.  You can use <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> to make a similar
choice for debugging.

</P>
<P>
GDB and <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> communicate via either a serial line
or a TCP connection, using the standard GDB remote serial
protocol.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>On the target machine,</EM>
<DD>
you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug.
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> does not need your program's symbol table, so you can
strip the program if necessary to save space.  GDB on the host
system does all the symbol handling.

To use the server, you must tell it how to communicate with GDB;
the name of your program; and the arguments for your program.  The
syntax is:


<PRE>
target&#62; gdbserver <VAR>comm</VAR> <VAR>program</VAR> [ <VAR>args</VAR> ... ]
</PRE>

<VAR>comm</VAR> is either a device name (to use a serial line) or a TCP
hostname and portnumber.  For example, to debug Emacs with the argument
<SAMP>`foo.txt'</SAMP> and communicate with GDB over the serial port
<TT>`/dev/com1'</TT>:


<PRE>
target&#62; gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt
</PRE>

<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> waits passively for the host GDB to communicate
with it.

To use a TCP connection instead of a serial line:


<PRE>
target&#62; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt
</PRE>

The only difference from the previous example is the first argument,
specifying that you are communicating with the host GDB via
TCP.  The <SAMP>`host:2345'</SAMP> argument means that <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> is to
expect a TCP connection from machine <SAMP>`host'</SAMP> to local TCP port 2345.
(Currently, the <SAMP>`host'</SAMP> part is ignored.)  You can choose any number
you want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any
TCP ports already in use on the target system (for example, <CODE>23</CODE> is
reserved for <CODE>telnet</CODE>).<A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="gdb_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A> You must use the same port number with the host GDB
<CODE>target remote</CODE> command.

<DT><EM>On the GDB host machine,</EM>
<DD>
you need an unstripped copy of your program, since GDB needs
symbols and debugging information.  Start up GDB as usual,
using the name of the local copy of your program as the first argument.
(You may also need the <SAMP>`--baud'</SAMP> option if the serial line is
running at anything other than 9600 bps.)  After that, use <CODE>target
remote</CODE> to establish communications with <CODE>gdbserver</CODE>.  Its argument
is either a device name (usually a serial device, like
<TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT>), or a TCP port descriptor in the form
<CODE><VAR>host</VAR>:<VAR>PORT</VAR></CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyb
</PRE>

communicates with the server via serial line <TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT>, and


<PRE>
(gdb) target remote the-target:2345
</PRE>

communicates via a TCP connection to port 2345 on host <TT>`the-target'</TT>.
For TCP connections, you must start up <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> prior to using
the <CODE>target remote</CODE> command.  Otherwise you may get an error whose
text depends on the host system, but which usually looks something like
<SAMP>`Connection refused'</SAMP>.

This example--run on an MS DOS 4.0 system--sets the PC port to 9600
bps, no parity, eight data bits, one stop bit, and no "retry" action;
you must match the communications parameters when establishing the Unix
end of the connection as well.

</P>
<P>
To give control of the PC to the Unix side of the serial line, type
the following at the DOS console:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; CTTY com1
</PRE>

<P>
(Later, if you wish to return control to the DOS console, you can use
the command <CODE>CTTY con</CODE>---but you must send it over the device that
had control, in our example over the <TT>`COM1'</TT> serial line).

</P>
<P>
From the Unix host, use a communications program such as <CODE>tip</CODE> or
<CODE>cu</CODE> to communicate with the PC; for example,

</P>

<PRE>
cu -s 9600 -l /dev/ttya
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>cu</CODE> options shown specify, respectively, the linespeed and the
serial port to use.  If you use <CODE>tip</CODE> instead, your command line
may look something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
tip -9600 /dev/ttya
</PRE>

<P>
Your system may require a different name where we show
<TT>`/dev/ttya'</TT> as the argument to <CODE>tip</CODE>.  The communications
parameters, including which port to use, are associated with the
<CODE>tip</CODE> argument in the "remote" descriptions file--normally the
system table <TT>`/etc/remote'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX589"></A>
Using the <CODE>tip</CODE> or <CODE>cu</CODE> connection, change the DOS working
directory to the directory containing a copy of your 29K program, then
start the PC program <CODE>EBMON</CODE> (an EB29K control program supplied
with your board by AMD).  You should see an initial display from
<CODE>EBMON</CODE> similar to the one that follows, ending with the
<CODE>EBMON</CODE> prompt <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>---

Then exit the <CODE>cu</CODE> or <CODE>tip</CODE> program (done in the example by
typing <CODE>~.</CODE> at the <CODE>EBMON</CODE> prompt).  <CODE>EBMON</CODE> keeps

</P>
<P>
For this example, we've assumed what is probably the most convenient
way to make sure the same 29K program is on both the PC and the Unix
system: a PC/NFS connection that establishes "drive <CODE>G:</CODE>" on the
PC as a file system on the Unix host.  If you do not have PC/NFS or
something similar connecting the two systems, you must arrange some
other way--perhaps floppy-disk transfer--of getting the 29K program
from the Unix system to the PC; GDB does <EM>not</EM> download it over the
serial line.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC120" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC120">EB29K cross-debugging</A></H4>

<P>
Finally, <CODE>cd</CODE> to the directory containing an image of your 29K
program on the Unix system, and start GDB---specifying as argument the
name of your 29K program:

</P>

<PRE>
cd /usr/joe/work29k
gdb myfoo
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can use the <CODE>target</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
target amd-eb /dev/ttya 9600 MYFOO
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, we've assumed your program is in a file called
<TT>`myfoo'</TT>.  Note that the filename given as the last argument to
<CODE>target amd-eb</CODE> should be the name of the program as it appears to DOS.
In our example this is simply <CODE>MYFOO</CODE>, but in general it can include
a DOS path, and depending on your transfer mechanism may not resemble
the name on the Unix side.

</P>
<P>
At this point, you can set any breakpoints you wish; when you are ready
to see your program run on the 29K board, use the GDB command
<CODE>run</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To stop debugging the remote program, use the GDB <CODE>detach</CODE>
command.

</P>
<P>
To return control of the PC to its console, use <CODE>tip</CODE> or <CODE>cu</CODE>
once again, after your GDB session has concluded, to attach to
<CODE>EBMON</CODE>.  You can then type the command <CODE>q</CODE> to shut down
<CODE>EBMON</CODE>, returning control to the DOS command-line interpreter.
Type <CODE>CTTY con</CODE> to return command input to the main DOS console,
and type <KBD>~.</KBD> to leave <CODE>tip</CODE> or <CODE>cu</CODE>.

If you have connected to the VxWorks target and you want to debug an
object that has not yet been loaded, you can use the GDB
<CODE>load</CODE> command to download a file from Unix to VxWorks
incrementally.  The object file given as an argument to the <CODE>load</CODE>
command is actually opened twice: first by the VxWorks target in order
to download the code, then by GDB in order to read the symbol
table.  This can lead to problems if the current working directories on
the two systems differ.  If both systems have NFS mounted the same
filesystems, you can avoid these problems by using absolute paths.
Otherwise, it is simplest to set the working directory on both systems
to the directory in which the object file resides, and then to reference
the file by its name, without any path.  For instance, a program
<TT>`prog.o'</TT> may reside in <TT>`<VAR>vxpath</VAR>/vw/demo/rdb'</TT> in VxWorks
and in <TT>`<VAR>hostpath</VAR>/vw/demo/rdb'</TT> on the host.  To load this
program, type this on VxWorks:

</P>

<PRE>
-&#62; cd "<VAR>vxpath</VAR>/vw/demo/rdb"

v
Then, in GDB, type:

</P>

<P>
GDB displays a response similar to this:

<P>
You can also use the <CODE>load</CODE> command to reload an object module
after editing and recompiling the corresponding source file.  Note that
this makes GDB delete all currently-defined breakpoints,
auto-displays, and convenience variables, and to clear the value
history.  (This is necessary in order to preserve the integrity of
debugger data structures that reference the target system's symbol

the serial port connected to the board.  If the program has not already
been downloaded to the board, you may use the <CODE>load</CODE> command to
download it.  You can then use all the usual GDB commands.

For example, this sequence connects to the target board through a serial
port, and loads and runs a program called <VAR>prog</VAR> through the
debugger:


<PRE>
host$ gdb <VAR>prog</VAR>
GDB is free software and ...
(gdb) target mips /dev/ttyb
(gdb) load <VAR>prog</VAR>
(gdb) run
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>target mips <VAR>hostname</VAR>:<VAR>portnumber</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
On some GDB host configurations, you can specify a TCP
connection (for instance, to a serial line managed by a terminal
concentrator) instead of a serial port, using the syntax
<SAMP>`<VAR>hostname</VAR>:<VAR>portnumber</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>target pmon <VAR>port</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX619"></A>

<DT><CODE>target ddb <VAR>port</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX620"></A>

<DT><CODE>target lsi <VAR>port</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX621"></A>

</DL>

<P>
GDB also supports these special commands for MIPS targets:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set processor <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>show processor</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX622"></A>
<A NAME="IDX623"></A>
Use the <CODE>set processor</CODE> command to set the type of MIPS
processor when you want to access processor-type-specific registers.
For example, <CODE>set processor <VAR>r3041</VAR></CODE> tells GDB 
to use the CPO registers appropriate for the 3041 chip.
Use the <CODE>show processor</CODE> command to see what MIPS processor GDB 
is using.  Use the <CODE>info reg</CODE> command to see what registers
GDB is using. 

<DT><CODE>set mipsfpu double</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>set mipsfpu single</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>set mipsfpu none</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>show mipsfpu</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX624"></A>
<A NAME="IDX625"></A>
<A NAME="IDX626"></A>
<A NAME="IDX627"></A>
If your target board does not support the MIPS floating point
coprocessor, you should use the command <SAMP>`set mipsfpu none'</SAMP> (if you
need this, you may wish to put the command in your 
file).  This tells GDB how to find the return value of
functions which return floating point values.  It also allows
GDB to avoid saving the floating point registers when calling
functions on the board.  If you are using a floating point coprocessor
with only single precision floating point support, as on the R4650
processor, use the command <SAMP>`set mipsfpu single'</SAMP>.  The default
double precision floating point coprocessor may be selected using
<SAMP>`set mipsfpu double'</SAMP>.

In previous versions the only choices were double precision or no
floating point, so <SAMP>`set mipsfpu on'</SAMP> will select double precision
and <SAMP>`set mipsfpu off'</SAMP> will select no floating point.

As usual, you can inquire about the <CODE>mipsfpu</CODE> variable with
<SAMP>`show mipsfpu'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>set remotedebug <VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>show remotedebug</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX628"></A>
<A NAME="IDX629"></A>
<A NAME="IDX630"></A>
<A NAME="IDX631"></A>
You can see some debugging information about communications with the board
by setting the <CODE>remotedebug</CODE> variable.  If you set it to <CODE>1</CODE> using
<SAMP>`set remotedebug 1'</SAMP>, every packet is displayed.  If you set it
to <CODE>2</CODE>, every character is displayed.  You can check the current value
at any time with the command <SAMP>`show remotedebug'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>set timeout <VAR>seconds</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>set retransmit-timeout <VAR>seconds</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>show timeout</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>show retransmit-timeout</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX632"></A>
<A NAME="IDX633"></A>
<A NAME="IDX634"></A>
<A NAME="IDX635"></A>
<A NAME="IDX636"></A>
<A NAME="IDX637"></A>
You can control the timeout used while waiting for a packet, in the MIPS
remote protocol, with the <CODE>set timeout <VAR>seconds</VAR></CODE> command.  The
default is 5 seconds.  Similarly, you can control the timeout used while
waiting for an acknowledgement of a packet with the <CODE>set
retransmit-timeout <VAR>seconds</VAR></CODE> command.  The default is 3 seconds.
You can inspect both values with <CODE>show timeout</CODE> and <CODE>show
retransmit-timeout</CODE>.  (These commands are <EM>only</EM> available when
GDB is configured for <SAMP>`--target=mips-idt-ecoff'</SAMP>.)

The timeout set by <CODE>set timeout</CODE> does not apply when GDB
is waiting for your program to stop.  In that case, GDB waits
forever because it has no way of knowing how long the program is going
to run before stopping.

For some configurations, GDB includes a CPU simulator that you
can use instead of a hardware CPU to debug your programs.
Currently, simulators are available for ARM, D10V, D30V, FR30, H8/300,
H8/500, i960, M32R, MIPS, MN10200, MN10300, PowerPC, SH, Sparc, V850,
W65, and Z8000.

</P>

<P>
For the Z8000 family, <SAMP>`target sim'</SAMP> simulates either the Z8002 (the
unsegmented variant of the Z8000 architecture) or the Z8001 (the
segmented variant).  The simulator recognizes which architecture is
appropriate by inspecting the object code.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>target sim <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX646"></A>
<A NAME="IDX647"></A>
Debug programs on a simulated CPU.  If the simulator supports setup
options, specify them via <VAR>args</VAR>.
</DL>

<P>
After specifying this target, you can debug programs for the simulated
CPU in the same style as programs for your host computer; use the
<CODE>file</CODE> command to load a new program image, the <CODE>run</CODE> command
to run your program, and so on.

</P>
<P>
As well as making available all the usual machine registers (see
<CODE>info reg</CODE>), the Z8000 simulator provides three additional items
of information as specially named registers:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>cycles</CODE>
<DD>
Counts clock-ticks in the simulator.

<DT><CODE>insts</CODE>
<DD>
Counts instructions run in the simulator.

<DT><CODE>time</CODE>
<DD>
Execution time in 60ths of a second. 
</DL>

<P>
You can refer to these values in GDB expressions with the usual
conventions; for example, <SAMP>`b fputc if $cycles&#62;5000'</SAMP> sets a
conditional breakpoint that suspends only after at least 5000
simulated clock ticks.
