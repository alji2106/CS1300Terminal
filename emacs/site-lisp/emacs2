;;; FILE: .emacs (with a period as the first character of the filename)
;;;
;;; This is Michael Main's emacs initialization file. You may use and modify
;;; this file as you like. For a Linux system, put .emacs in your own home
;;; directory. For Windows, put .emacs (or _emacs) in one of these:
;;; 1. The directory given by HOME environment variable.
;;; 2. The subdirectory site-lisp under the directory given by the
;;;    EMACS_HOME environment variable.
;;; 3. C:\
;;;
;;; Note that I have made a lot of
;;; changes to the usual emacs key bindings (in order to make it look
;;; more like the editor that I use at home.) You might want to delete
;;; most of these keybindings, and leave only the preferences and
;;; vt100 terminal stuff.--- Michael (Jan 5, 1999)
