It is best to start a lab exercise during your assigned recitation period. 
If you run into any immediate problems, one of the instructors will be able to help. 
However, some of you might have missed your assigned time during the first week. 
If so, then you'll need to work on your own home machine or
go to one of the PC labs on your own to get started.
<P>

<B>Required Completion Date</B>
<P>
This exercise must be completed as soon as possible after your first
recitation. 
Otherwise you won't have time to complete the first homework
(which is due the next week).

Set up Your University Account and Identikey
</B>
<UL><LI>
If you are working in the university PC labs, you must first have a university
account and identikey password. If you've already set these up, go to
the next step. Otherwise, there are two methods to set up the account
(as described in
the handout <I>Getting Started with Computing</I>,
available in ECCR 239):
<OL>
<LI>From any web-connected machine (including the ones in the
first-floor lobby of the Engineering Center, just east of the
revolving doors)
<UL>
<LI>
Press the return key, and you should get a small grey box.
Then click on the "Set Identikey" button and follow the directions
to set up your university PC account.
</UL>
<LI>Or you can
visit the Information Technology Service Center on the first floor
of the Telecommunications Building (two buildings east of the
University
Memorial Center). If you can't find them, telephone at 303-735-HELP.
Bring your BuffOne card for identification.
</UL>
<P><LI>
Now, whenever you use a university PC,
your first task is to login through the Identikey system. Do this by
pressing
the return key to get the login screen, then type your login name and
IdentiKey password. This will take you to the Windows work screen.

<P><LI>
At the beginning of each lab exercise, you'll need to prepare the PC
to use the CS1300 software. There are several ways to do this,
depending on your location:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Option 1: On Engineering Center PCs: Server Method</B>
<DD>On PCs in the Engineering Center, try this method first. If it
doesn't work, then try the next method instead.
<OL>
<LI>Start a DOS session by clicking: Start, Programs, MS-DOS Prompt.
<LI>If the DOS
session takes up the whole screen, then reduce it to a smaller window
by holding down the Alt key and pressing Enter.
<LI>
From the DOS-session, try this command: 
<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;H:\gocs</CODE>
<BR>If the command doesn't
seem to work, then ask your TA whether the H:\ should be changed
to something else.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Or Option 2: On your home PC:</B>
<DD>
Directions for permanently installing the CS1300 software on your home
machine are at
<A
HREF="../README.html">www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/README.html</A>.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Or Option 3: On Most PCs: Download Method</B>
<DD>You can use this method on any machine with a fast internet
connection and about 100MB of free disk drive space.
<OL>
<LI>Start a DOS session by clicking: Start, Programs, MS-DOS Prompt.
<LI>If the DOS
session takes up the whole screen, then reduce it to a smaller window
by holding down the Alt key and pressing Enter.
<LI>Open a browser (Netscape or IE) and point it at each of these two

Create a Working Directory

<P>
At the end of the installation step, you should have a DOS window open
where you will carry out all your work.
<P>    This exercise assumes that you're already familiar with MS Windows
    and that you can create directories or "folders", and move files
    from one directory to another. For this exercise, you should start
    by creating a separate directory for this work. I put my working directory on my
    D: drive and called it D:\michael. From the DOS command line, the
    commands to create and move into this directory are:
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;D:</CODE>
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd \</CODE>
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir michael</CODE>
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd michael</CODE>

Always put your work in a subdirectory (rather than at the top of the
disk drive). There are certain parts of the debugger that won't work
correctly at the top of a disk drive.

Copying and Listing Files
</STRONG> </DT>
<P>
    <DD>
    Now you'll copy some files into your working directory. Let's
    assume
    that the cs1300 tools are on the H: drive,
    and that you've just completed the four commands in the previous step.
    You can copy the necessary files to your working directory with
    these commands from the DOS command line:
<PRE>
        copy H:\cs1300\lab\*.cxx
        copy H:\cs1300\lab\*.h
</PRE>
    If your cs1300 software is not on H:, then type the correct drive
    letter rather than H:.
    After you've done this copying, list the working directory (with
    the dir command) and you should see at least these files (though the sizes
    and dates might be slightly different).

Compiling and Running a C++ Program

<UL><P><LI>
The files that you copied are C++ programs.
The last part of the files' names, <CODE>
cxx</CODE>, indicates that the file is a C++ program. Some files end
with .h, indicating that they are special "header" files.
The first program that you'll examine is <CODE>heatwave.cxx</CODE>, which computes
some information about heating a house, 
but the real purpose of the program is to demonstrate what a program 
looks like and how to run a program on a machine.
<P>
Later, during your reading assignment, you can look at how this program was written. But for now 
you will simply see how to run a program such as this one. The first step in running a program is 
to run the C++ compiler. A compiler does the task of translating from a programming language 
(such as C++) to the low level instructions that a computer actually runs. Our compiler is 
Version 2.7 of the Gnu C++ compiler. You can start the compiler from
the DOS command line by typing this command:
<PRE>
    g++ -Wall -gstabs heatwave.cxx -o heatwave
</PRE>
<P><LI>Possible errors:
<OL>
<P><LI>
    During the compilation, you might get errors. If you are working
    on your home machine with permanent installation, then check that
    the lines added to your autoexec.bat file are exactly correct.
<P><LI>
Errors indicating "Out of Environment Space": See the directions for
fixing this in 
<A HREF="envspace.html">www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/lab/envspace.html
</A>.
</UL>
<P><LI>
In your compilation command,
    the <CODE>-Wall</CODE> option instructs the compiler to list all warning messages.
    These warning messages usually  indicate programming errors, and we'll
    forbid most warning messages in your programs. The <CODE>-gstabs</CODE> option
    puts extra debugging information into your program.
    At the end of the compilation
    line, the arguments <CODE>-o&nbsp;heatwave</CODE> indicate that the compiler should put
    its result (the "object  code") in a file called heatwave.exe. If you don't
    specify a location for the object code, then the compiler  places its
    result in a file named a.exe, which is not a particularly useful name.
    <P>
    Anyway, compile the heatwave program now (as shown above), and then list
    your files again. You should see these files:
<PRE>
    HEATWAVE CXX         2,135  07-19-99  2:30p heatwave.cxx

Using GNU emacs
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    In order to modify any of your files, you'll
    need to use one of the text editors. Some of your have probably used a
    text editor before, such as edit, vi, pico, or even emacs. In the past,
    we have let students use whichever editor they wanted. But this
    semester I'd like everyone to use an editor that has a good degree of
    integration with a compiler and other tools. The editor is called GNU
    emacs (yes, the G in GNU is pronounced!).
    <P>
    You'll first use emacs to edit heatwave.cxx.
    In order to start emacs and edit the heatwave.cxx file, give this
    command from the command line:
 
    <P><CODE>
    emacs  heatwave.cxx
    </CODE><P>

    The editor will open, and display the current contents of your heatwave.cxx
    file. Spend one minute using the terminal's arrow keys to browse through
    the file. You can also use the keys to page down or page
    up. Each line of the file is part of a small C++ program.
    The lines near the top are comments indicating what the program does.
    One of these comments says that the program is an exercise for
    Irving Forbush. Use the backspace key to erase Irving's name and
    put your name instead.
    <P>
    After you make this change, you may write out the new heatwave.cxx
    file,
    by typing Ctrl-x followed by Ctrl-s, and answering y to the prompt at the bottom of the
    screen.

Six Pieces of C++
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    The next step of this lab is to browse through heatwave.cxx a bit.
    Using emacs, open the file heatwave.cxx. You might notice that emacs
    recognized the program as a C++ program, and put the characters (C++)
    in the status line at the bottom. Move through the program and
    find the following aspects:
    <OL>

    <P> 
    <LI>
    Comments in C++ are indicated by two slashes in a row. The entire line,
    after the // is a comment.

    <P>
    <LI>
    The program has two include directives that include two C++
    libraries:

    <P><CODE>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;   // Provides cin, cout
    <BR>
    #include &lt;cstdlib&gt;    // Provides EXIT_SUCCESS
    </CODE><P>

    These directive will appear in most every C++ program. The library
    iostream provides standard input and output functions and devices such
    as the standard input. The library cstdlib provides several other 
    standard items such as a constant named EXIT_SUCCESS that our program
    uses. 

    <P>
    <LI>
    After the two include directives, the program declares a double number
    named PI. But PI is no ordinary  variable; it is a constant variable,
    declared as shown here:

    <P><CODE>
    const double PI = 3.14159;
    </CODE><P>

    A constant declaration, such as this, is a new feature of C and C++. They
    are like ordinary variable declarations that are given an initial value,
    but because they are declared as a const, the compiler will prevent you 
    from writing any statements that change the value of this variable. In
    this class, our programming style  requires the names of all constants to
    be written in capital letters, allowing constants to be easily spotted.

    <P>
    <LI>
    Search through the code and find the heading of the main program,
    which
    begins with the words "int&nbsp;". The word int indicates that the
    main program computes an integer value and returns this value to
    the Windows operating system. This may
    be different than your textbook--many programmers  simply
    declare the main program as a void function (which means that it
    does
    not give any final value back to the operating system).
    But we suggest that your  main program returns an int value, since this
    integer can be used to tell the operating system whether the  program was
    successful or not. For our compilers, a main program returns the number 0
    to indicate successful termination. For our g++ compiler, this
    "successful return value" is defined in cstdlib as a constant  called
    EXIT_SUCCESS. Can you find the return statement in heatwave's main
    program, which indicates  successful termination? (Be warned: older
    compilers on our DEC machines don't define EXIT_SUCCESS.  If you are using
    an older machine some day, you can still compile by adding the string        
    -DEXIT_SUCCESS=0 immediately after the g++).

    <P>
    <LI>
    Some output is quite simple in C++. A basic output statement looks like
    this:

    <P><CODE>
    cout &lt;&lt; "How big is your tree?" &lt;&lt; endl;
    </CODE><P>

    The name cout is the "console output device"--the screen. The operator 
    &lt;&lt;
    is the output operator. So this  statement sends the string "How big is
    your tree?" to the console output device, and then the special object,
    endl, is sent to the console output device. The object endl is an
    end-of-line, and it also serves  to "flush" the output (meaning that the
    output will be written then and there, rather than waiting for some 
    output buffer to fill up).

    <P>
    <LI>
    Some input is also quite simple in C++. A basic input statement looks like
    this:

    <P><CODE>
    cin &gt;&gt; radius;
    </CODE><P>

    The name cin is the "console input device"--the keyboard. The operator 
    &gt;&gt;
    is the input operator. So this  statement inputs a real number into the
    variable radius. You'll learn a lot more about input/output in other 
    labs, but this will do for now.

Emacs Indenting
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    When emacs knows that a file is a C++ program, it can help
    you to make sensible indentation. To demonstrate this ability, go down
    into the body of heatwave.cxx, and mess up the indentation on a few lines.
    Get rid of some spaces or add some extra spaces at the start of a line.
    Just mess it up some way.
    Then press the Esc key followed by p. The letter p stands for "pretty-print," and the
    command will nicely indent your entire program.
    This command is one of the things that I set up in your emacs
    initialization file.
    <P>
    Here are the indentation items that I have set up in the
    initialization file:
    <UL>
        <P>
   <LI> The TAB key: When you press TAB, emacs will attempt to
             correctly indent the current line.
        <P>
   <LI> The RETURN key: When you press the RETURN key, emacs will
             indent the current line, insert a blank line, and move the
             cursor to the right spot to start typing. If the first
             character of the newline is a bracket, then its indentation
             will be corrected after you type the bracket.
        If you find that you need to turn off the annoying behavior
             of the RETURN key, then go into your .emacs file and put
             three semi-colons at the front of the lines that look like this:
	     <P><CODE>
             (local-set-key [13] 'tab-return-tab)
             </CODE><P>
   <P>
   <LI> The Pretty-Printer: When you press the Esc key and then press p,
             emacs will nicely indent the entire file.

    Now that you know about pretty-printing, you can
    move to the next step.

Compiling from within Emacs
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    At the moment you are looking at heatwave.cxx from within emacs. You
    can actually compile heatwave.cxx without stopping the editor. To compile
    from within the editor, press the escape key once, press x, type the word
    "compile", and press return. The "mini-window" at the bottom of the screen
    will change to this message:

    <P><CODE>
    Compile command: make -k
    </CODE><P>

    Use the backspace key to erase "make -k", and instead type your usual
    compilation command, so that the mini-window looks like this:

    <P><CODE>
    Compile command: g++ -Wall heatwave.cxx -o heatwave
    </CODE><P>

    Then press return. When you press return, the screen will split into
    two pieces. The top piece is still your heatwave program. The bottom
    piece is a new window that will contain any error messages from the
    compilation. During the compilation, there will also be a message
    near the bottom of the screen indicating "Compilation: run Compiling".
    When the compilation finishes, the message changes to "Compilation:
    exit[0]". If there were no compilation errors, you can get rid of
    the compile window by giving the "one window" command (Ctrl-x followed
    by typing the digit 1).

<DL> 
<DT> <STRONG><INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="Register">
Finding Compilation Errors
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    Compiling from within emacs is a big help when there are compilation
    errors. For example, let's put a compilation error into the
    heatwave.cxx file. Go down to the input line "cin &gt;&gt; height;" 
    and delete
    the semicolon at the end of the line. This is certainly an error!
    Move the cursor away from this error before you proceed to the next
    paragraph.
    <P>
    Now, type the compile command again (ESCAPE x compile RETURN). Notice that
    when you press return, the miniwindow still remembers your compilation
    command, so just press return once more to get the compilation underway.
    When the new compilation starts, emacs will ask whether you want to
    save the changes to heatwave.cxx before compiling. You should answer
    y (otherwise the compilation would compile the old version of
    heatwave.cxx, which did not have an error).
    The compilation will find your syntax error pretty quickly, and display
    some error message such as "heatwave.cxx:42: parse error before `<'". 
    <P>
    With the error message in the compilation window, you can ask emacs to
    move the cursor to the location of the error. The emacs "find error"
    command is Ctrl-x followed by the "backquote" key. (The backquote key is
    the single quote mark that seems to go backward.) Give this command now.
    Emacs will move the error message to the top of the compilation window,
    and move the cursor in the program to line 42. Line 42 is actually one
    line after the real error. (Remember that usually you must move backward
    from the error line to find the location of the actual syntax error.)
    Go ahead and fix this syntax error now, and save the file before
    moving to the next step.

Modifying the Heatwave Program
</B>
<UL><LI>
The heatwave program prints its answer in days. 
In order to show you how to modify a program, we'll add weeks to 
the answer. 
At this point you still don't need to understand how the program is
working--it 
is enough to just understand how to modify a program in the way that these steps describe.</P>
<P CLASS="Main-body-small-type">
<A NAME="pgfId=2558">
 </A>
For the first modification, move to the top part of the program and find the
lines shown here:</P>
<PRE>
    double height;            // Height of a tree in feet
    double radius;            // Radius of a tree in feet
    double requirement;       // Cubic feet of wood to heat house for a day
    double volume;            // Volume of the tree in cubic feet
    double days;              // Number of days that tree will heat house
</PRE>
These lines tell the program to use memory locations to keep track of
various computational values.
We'll tell the program to keep track of one more value, the
approximate
number of weeks that the tree will heat the house. 
To do this move the cursor to the end of these lines--somewhere after the words 
&quot;<CODE>
will heat house&quot;</CODE>.
You can move the cursor here with the arrow keys, or by moving the mouse to the location and clicking 
the left button. Once the cursor is here, press return, which will open up a new line. On the new 
line you should type:
<PRE>
int weeks;                // Number of whole weeks that tree will heat house
</PRE>
Try to align your new line with the rest of the program, aligning
front of each line,
and aligning the slashes 
 (which indicate the start of a comment that is meant to be read by a person).
<P><LI>
For the second modification, find these lines:
<PRE>
    // Computations
    volume = height * PI * radius * radius;
    days = volume / requirement;

    // Output days
    cout &lt;&lt; "That tree will heat a house for " &lt;&lt; days &lt;&lt; " days." &lt;&lt; endl;
</PRE>
Add the two new lines shown here:
<PRE>
    // Computations
    volume = height * PI * radius * radius;
    days = volume / requirement;
    weeks = (int) days / 7;

    // Output days
    cout &lt;&lt; "That tree will heat a house for " &lt;&lt; days &lt;&lt; " days." &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Which is " &lt;&lt; weeks &lt;&lt; " whole weeks." &lt;&lt; endl;
</PRE>
The first new line calculates the number of whole weeks by dividing
the days by 7. The second new line prints this number of whole weeks.
<P>
Now save and recompile the program (from within emacs). After recompilation,
you can click on your DOS window and run the program by typing its
name. You might be surprised to see that the number of whole weeks was
rounded down. This rounding down to a whole integer occurs whenever
a value is assigned to an integer variable.

<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy heatwave.cxx lpt1</CODE>
<BR>Note that the last word in this command starts with the lowercase 
letter l and ends with the number 1 (it stands for "line printer number one").

When you are satisfied that the program is running correctly,  shut down emacs by pressing
its close X in the top right corner. (Or by pressing Ctrl-x followed
by Ctrl-c.)
    <P><LI>
    As the semester progresses, you'll learn a lot more about emacs. For
    example, you can change the definitions of various keys to match
    your own preferences for editing operations. You can invoke a debugger
    from within emacs. For now however, a
    summary of basic editing commands
    should be sufficient, available at
    <A HREF="emacs.html">

If you have an account on a university machine, such as ucsub or ucsu, you can also transfer files back and
forth between the PC and the university machine. You'll use a program called ftp, following
these steps:
<OL>
<LI> From the DOS command line, type the command:
<CODE>ftp&nbsp;ucsub.colorado.edu</CODE>
(or use <CODE>ucsu</CODE> if your account is on <CODE>ucsu</CODE>).
<LI> Type your login name and password for the university machine.
<LI> To send a file (such as heatwave.cxx) to the university machine,
type:
<CODE>put&nbsp;heatwave.cxx</CODE>
<LI> To retrieve a file (such as heatwave.cxx) from the university machine,
type:
<CODE>get&nbsp;heatwave.cxx</CODE>
<LI>When you are done using ftp, type the command <CODE>bye</CODE>.
</OL>
<P>
Some of the Engineering PCs also have a graphical version of the ftp
program
that's available through the Start|Programs menu.
