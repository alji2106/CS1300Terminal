This week's lab
introduces another important tool: The <STRONG>make</STRONG> facility.
This facility allows you to easily maintain and keep your files up to date
when you are working on a project that is split accross several cxx files
(and their associated header files). For each of your future assignments,
you should keep all of the files for that assignment in one directory, and
create a make file to manage the files in that directory.

Copy an Example Makefile
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    This week's lab exercise starts in your working directory.
    You'll need to copy four files into that directory from the
    installed cs1300\lab\ directory:
<PRE>
    <A HREF="makefile">makefile</A>
    <A HREF="sinewave.cxx">sinewave</A>
    <A HREF="intarray.cxx">intarray.cxx</A>
    <A HREF="intarray.h">intarray.h</A>
</PRE>

What's in a Makefile?
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    The file makefile is the usual input file for a tool called make. The 
    purpose of make is to help you maintain and update a collection of related
    program files. The collection usually has header files, cxx files, and 
    compiled files--all of which depend on each other. For example, consider 
    last week's sinewave program.
    The final product is an executable file named 
    sinewave.exe, which is created by linking together two other compiled files, 
    sinewave.o and intarray.o. The two compiled files were created by 
    compiling 
    <A HREF=
    "sinewave.cxx"
    >
    sinewave.cxx
    </A>
    and
    <A HREF=
    "intarray.cxx"
    >
    intarray.cxx
    </A>
    (both of which used the header file
    <A HREF=
    "intarray.h"
    >
    intarray.h</A>).
    The complete dependencies among the files can be 
    drawn like this:
    <P>
    <IMG SRC="makew.gif">
    <P>
    The upward arrows in the file express how each file is created. For
    example, the file sinewave.o is created by compiling sinewave.cxx and  also
    includes intarray.h. To state the matter simply: 

    <P><I>
    If sinewave.cxx or intarray.h changes, then sinewave.o must be regenerated 
    by giving the compiler command:</I>
    <BR><CODE>
    g++ -Wall -c -gstabs sinewave.cxx
    </CODE><P>

    This requirement
    to sometimes regenerate sinewave.o is one of the dependencies
    that the example makefile expresses. To see this dependency, use emacs
    to open up the file named makefile. 
    <P>
    Near the bottom of the file you'll find these two lines:

<P><PRE>
sinewave.o: sinewave.cxx intarray.h
        g++ -Wall -c -gstabs sinewave.cxx
</PRE><P>

    The first line is called a target line, which begins with a file name and
    a colon. After the colon is a list of  more file names. Here's how to
    interpret the line: The file before the colon (called the target file)
    depends on  the other files (after the colon). Whenever one of the files
    after the colon changes, the make tool knows that  the target file needs
    to be regenerated. After the target line, there is a series of commands
    that tell exactly  how to regenerate the target file. For the case of
    sinewave.o, we only need the one g++ command to  regenerate the file.
    (Notice that we included the -c flag to indicate that we should only
    compile and not create an executable file yet. We also included the
    -gstabs flag in case we want to use the debugger.)
    <P>
    There is one
    other peculiar requirement: The command lines (such as the g++ command)
    must  each begin with a tab <STRONG>(not with 8 spaces!)</STRONG>.
    <P>
    As a second example of a dependency, the executable file sinewave.exe is
    created by compiling together the  object files sinewave.o and intarray.o.
    If either of these two object files should change, then sinewave.exe also
    needs to be recreated. Here is the appropriate target line and command
    from our makefile:

<P><PRE>
sinewave.exe: sinewave.o intarray.o
        g++ -Wall -gstabs sinewave.o intarray.o -o sinewave
</PRE><P>

    This target line says that if sinewave.o or intarray.o should happen to
    change, then the sinewave.exe  must be regenerated with the g++ command that is
    shown.
</DL>

Using Make to Regenerate a Specified Target File
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    In order to illustrate how the make facility works, start by getting rid of
    all the object files and executable files.  You can do this with the
    delete command:

    <P><PRE>
    del  intarray.o 
    del  sinewave.o 
    del  sinewave.exe
    </PRE>

    There are two simple ways to use the make facility to automatically
    regenerate
    your files. The first approach  regenerates a specific file. For example,
    suppose you want to regenerate intarray.o. Then you can use  the make
    command, as shown here:

    <P><CODE>
    make -k intarray.o
    </CODE><P>

    The make command will find the dependency information in the makefile
    file. It sees that intarray.o  depends on other files, so it will first
    ensure that those files are present (and regenerate them if necessary). In
    this example, the two files intarray.h and intarray.cxx are necessary for
    generating  intarray.o. These two files are present, so the make command
    proceeds to generate intarray.o,  using the g++ command that is specified
    in the makefile. When the g++ command is executed, it is  displayed on the
    screen, so you will see this appear on the screen:

    <P><CODE>
    g++ -Wall -c -gstabs intarray.cxx
    </CODE><P>

    After this command finishes, you should list the files in your directory,
    where you will find the object file  intarray.o is once again present.
</DL>

<DL> 
<DT> <STRONG><INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="Register">
Using Make without Specifying a Target File
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    You may also use the make command without specifying a file, like this:

    <P><CODE>
    make -k
    </CODE><P>

    Without a specified file, the make command will regenerate the first
    target that it finds in  makefile. Try  this now, and you will see that
    the executable file sinewave.exe is regenerated, since sinewave.exe is the first 
    target file in makefile. During the process of regenerating the sinewave.exe
    file, the make command had  to carry out several steps. In the first step,
    the make command realizes that sinewave.exe depends on  intarray.o and also on
    sinewave.o. But the file sinewave.o is not present. So, the make command 
    first regenerates sinewave.o, and then it can proceed to regenerate the
    executable file sinewave. On the  screen you'll see the two steps
    displayed:

    <P><CODE>
    g++ -Wall -c -gstabs sinewave.cxx
    <BR>
    g++ -Wall -gstabs sinewave.o intarray.o -lm -o sinewave
    </CODE><P>
</DL>

<DT> <STRONG><INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="Register">
Using Make from within Emacs
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    The best feature of the make command is how it automatically keeps track
    of exactly which object files and  executable files need to be recompiled.
    As an example, you should now change one of your source files. I  suggest
    that you use emacs to
    make a small change to the sinewave.cxx program, perhaps adding
    another small output  statement. Then save the new sinewave.cxx
    (CTRL-x s) and
    from within emacs give the compile command (ESC x compile RETURN).
    <P>
    What happens? The emacs compile command automatically issues the
    "make -k" command. The make facility realizes that sinewave.cxx has changed, and
    therefore the object file  sinewave.o is regenerated with the command:

    <P><CODE>
    g++  -Wall -c -gstabs  sinewave.cxx
    </CODE><P>

    Next, the make facility realizes that sinewave.o has just changed, and
    therefore the executable file  sinewave.exe is regenerated with:
    
    <P><CODE>
    g++  -Wall -gstabs sinewave.o intarray.o -lm -o sinewave
    </CODE><P>

    But, notice that the object file intarray.o was not recompiled. The
    dependencies in the makefile were  sufficient to show that intarray.o did
    not need recreation.
</DL>

<DL> 
<DT> <STRONG><INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="Register">
Using Make with Special Targets
</STRONG> </DT>
    <DD>
    A makefile can also have special target lines that carry out special
    actions rather than regenerate files. There  are two such target lines at
    the bottom of the example makefile:

<P><PRE>
clean:
        rm $(EXPENDABLES)

all:
        @make $(EXPENDABLES)
</PRE><P>

    The special target clean simply removes all of the files that can be
    generated. (These are called the  "expendable" files because they are easy
    to replace by regenerating them.) It does the removal with the rm
    command (which is part of the compiler files that you downloaded).
    The rm command removes one or more files.
    The term $(EXPENDABLES) is a
    macro expansion--meaning that the make command will look elsewhere in the file for the
    meaning of the word EXPENDABLES.
    It will find this at the top of the file, where 
    EXPENDABLES is defined to be the sequence of all files that we can
    regenerate.
    <P>
    The special target "all" generates all expendable files.
    The @ symbol in front of make command suppresses
    printing of the command, so that "make. . ." will not be printed on the
    screen.

    The two special targets can be activated just like any other target. For
    example:

    <P><CODE>
    make -k all
    </CODE><P>

    The make all command is useful when you want to make certain that all
    files are up to date. It will only regenerate files that need to
    be regenerated because the corresponding cxx or h files have changed.
