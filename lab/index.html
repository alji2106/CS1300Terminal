<P><DT><B>Exams</B>
<DD>
The purpose of the exams is to ensure that you
have a basic understanding of the
material that's required to take further computer science courses.
With this in mind, we'll provide you with precise study guides for
each exam. In order to move on to the next computer science course
(with a grade of at least C- in CSCI 1300), you must have strong
performance on these exams and do a certain amount of the programming
homework. For better a better course grade (an A or B), you must also
complete significant additional programming projects (as described in
the 
Grade Guide at <A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/intro/grading.html">
www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/intro/grading.html</A>).
<P>
Please read the course syllabus (<A

for a listing of the exam dates.

<P><DT><B>Course Policy</B>
<IMG SRC="caution.gif" ALT="[CAUTION!]">
<DD>
In order to effectively learn how to program,
all work that you submit in this class must be entirely your own.
In particular:
<UL>
<LI>
You MAY talk with other people about the assignments and the
high-level design of a solution.
<LI>
Other people MAY answer questions, including writing a couple lines of code
with pencil and paper to show you the syntax of some programming feature.
<LI>
If you receive such help, you MUST include the name and email address
of the other person in clear comment at the top of your program.
This includes tutors that you hire (please show this policy to any tutor).
<LI>
You MUST NOT look at any other person's program on a printout or
screen before completing and submitting your own work.
<LI>
You MUST NOT work together with another person, devising just one
solution between the two of you.
<LI>
You MUST NOT copy any part of any other person's files, not even
to use the copy as a "reference".
</UL>
Breaking these rules will result in an F for the entire course.
