<H2>Installation of the CS1300 Software</H2>
<P>
This note describes how to install the CS1300 software on your home
machine so that it is automatically available each time that you open
a DOS window. 
You'll need about 100,000,000 bytes of free space on the hard drive.

<DT><B>Step A: Obtaining the Files</B>
<DD>To start, you'll need to get these two files and put them at the
top level of the disc drive that you plan to use:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../unzip.exe">www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/unzip.exe</A>
<LI><A HREF="../cs1300.zip">www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/cs1300.zip</A>
</UL>
<P>
The second of these files is large (about 22MB), but even a modem
internet connection can probably download it overnight. If you don't
want to wait overnight, you can download the files to a machine in the
Engineering Center and copy them to a zip disc if you have a zip
drive. Or you can buy a CD-ROM that contains the two files ($2 from
your course instructor).

<OL>
<LI>Start a DOS session by clicking: Start, Programs, MS-DOS Prompt.
<LI>If the DOS
session takes up the whole screen, then reduce it to a smaller window
by holding down the Alt key and pressing Enter.
<LI>Click on the small MS-DOS icon in the upper left corner of the DOS
session.
Select Properties, Advanced. Make sure that the box "Prevent
MS-DOS-based programs..." is NOT checked. Click OK to get back to the
Prompt Properties screen. 
<LI>Select the Memory tab. In the "Initial environment" box, increase
the number to 4096. Click OK.
<LI>Shut down the DOS-session by clicking the X in the upper right
corner. Then restart a new DOS-session.
<LI>
From the DOS-session, given these commands (changing the letter C: to
the letter of your hard drive that contains the two files):
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd \
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unzip cs1300.zip
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;del&nbsp;unzip.exe
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;del&nbsp;cs1300.zip</CODE>
<BR>
   Check that the cs1300 directory was created on your hard drive. Within this
   directory, there should be several subdirectories (doc,
   emacs, bin, lib, include, samples, share, and maybe more).

<LI>
Change to your root directory on your C: drive and
give the command <CODE>edit&nbsp;autoexec.bat</CODE> to open your
autoexec.bat file. Note that this is the C: drive, not
necessarily the drive that you are using for the cs1300 software.
Add the following lines to the end of this
autoexec.bat file (changing the letter C: to the letter of the
hard drive where you installed the cs1300 software):
<PRE>
SET EMACS_HOME=C:\cs1300\emacs
SET C_INCLUDE_PATH=C:\cs1300\include
SET CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=C:\cs1300\include\g++;C:\cs1300\include
SET LIBRARY_PATH=C:\cs1300\lib
SET GCC_EXEC_PREFIX=C:\cs1300\lib\gcc-lib\
SET BISON_SIMPLE=C:\cs1300\share\bison.simple
SET BISON_HAIRY=C:\cs1300\share\bison.hairy
PATH=%PATH%;C:\cs1300\bin
</PRE>
Notice that there is a backslash at the end of "gcc-lib" in one of
these commands.
<LI>Shut down your machine and reboot so that the autoexec.bat commands
will be executed. 
</UL>
